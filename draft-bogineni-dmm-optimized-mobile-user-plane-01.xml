      <t>
      3GPP CT4 has approved a study item to study different mobility management protocols for potential replacement of GTP tunnels between UPFs (N9 Interface) in the 3GPP 5G system architecture. 
      </t>

      <t>
      This document provides an overview of 5G system architecture in the context of N9 Interface which is the scope of the 3GPP CT4 study item (<xref target="TS.23.501-3GPP"/>, <xref target="TS.23.502-3GPP"/>, 
      <xref target="TS.23.503-3GPP"/>, <xref target="TS.23.203-3GPP"/>, <xref target="TS.29.244-3GPP"/>, 
      <xref target="TS.29.281-3GPP"/>, <xref target="TS.38.300-3GPP"/>, and <xref target="TS.38.401-3GPP"/>).
      The requirements for the network functions and the relevant interfaces are provided.
      </t>
      
      
      <t>
      Reference scenarios and criteria for evaluation of various IETF protocols are provided. 
      </t>
      
      <t>
      Several IETF protocols are considered for comparison: SRv6, LISP, ILA and several combinations of control plane and user plane protocols.

    <section title="Introduction and Problem Statement">
      <t>
      3GPP CT4 WG has approved a study item [CT4SID] to study user-plane protocol for N9 in 5GC architecture 
      as specified in <xref target="TS.23.501-3GPP"/> and <xref target="TS.23.502-3GPP"/> for Rel-15. 
      This provides an opportunity to investigate potential limits of the existing user plane solution and 
      potential benefits of alternative user plane solutions.
      </t>
      
      <t>
      #Include scope of CT4 study item (user plane)
      </t>
      
      <t>
      #Add SA2 study item and relevant scope of the work (control plane)
      </t>
      
      <t>
      #Scope of control plane and user plane considerations
      </t>
      
      <t>
      IETF has some protocols for potential consideration as candidates. These protocols have the potential to 
      simplify the architecture through reduction/elimination of encapsulation; use of native routing mechanisms; 
      support of anchor-less mobility management; reduction of session state and reduction of signaling associated 
      with mobility management. 
      </t>
      
      <t>
      This document comprehensively describes the various protocols and how they can be used in the 3GPP 5G 
      architecture. Specifically Segment Routing v6 (SRv6), Locator Identifier Separation Protocol (LISP) and 
      Identifier Locator Addressing (ILA) are described in the context of the 3GPP 5G architecture for several 
      scenarios: as a replacement of GTP on N9; as a replacement of GTP in the whole system; integrated with transport; 
      used in specific network slices, etc.   
      </t>
      
      <t>
      A comparison of the variosu protocols is also provided.

    <section title="Conventions Used in This Document">
      <t>
      In examples, "C:" and "S:" indicate lines sent by the client and server respectively.
      </t>
      
      <t>
      The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", 
      and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 <xref target="RFC2119"/>. 
      </t>
      
      <t>
      In this document, these words will appear with that interpretation   only when in ALL CAPS. Lower case uses of 
      these words are not to be    interpreted as carrying significance described in RFC 2119.
      </t>
      
      <t>
      In this document, the characters ">>" preceding an indented line(s)   indicates a statement using the key words 
      listed above. This convention aids reviewers in quickly identifying or finding the portions of this RFC covered by these keywords.
      </t>
    </section>
      
    <section title="Overview of Existing Architecture and Protocol Stack">
      <t>
      This section briefly describes the 5G system architecture as specified in <xref target="TS.23.501-3GPP"/> The key relevant features 
      for session management and mobility management are:
      <list style="symbols">
      <t>
      Separate the User Plane (UP) functions from the Control Plane (CP) functions, allowing independent scalability, evolution and 
      flexible deployments e.g. centralized location or distributed (remote) location.
      </t>
      
      <t>
      Support concurrent access to local and centralized services. To support low latency services and access to local data networks, 
      UP functions can be deployed close to the Access Network.
      </t>
      
      <t>
      Support roaming with both Home routed traffic as well as Local breakout traffic in the visited PLMN.

      The roaming architectures supports two options.
      </t>
      
      <t>
      In Local Breakout model, visted operator routes user traffic locally through
      UPFs that are local to the visted operator. In this model, the SMF and 
      all UPF(s) involved by the PDU Session are located and are under the control 
      of the Visited PLMN (VPLMN).
      </t>
      
      <t>
      In Home Routed model, user traffic is routed to the UPF in Home PLMN(HPLMN)
      via the UPF in the visited network. In this scenario, the SMF in HPLMN 
      selects the UPF(s) in the HPLMN and the SMF in VPLMN selects the UPF(s)
      in the VPLMN. 
      </t>
      
      <t>
      Local Breakout and Home Routed roaming models are depicted in the two figures below.

      GTPv1-U as defined in <xref target="TS.29.281-3GPP"/> is used over the N3 and N9 interfaces in Release 15. Release 15 is still 
      work-in-progress and RAN3 will specify the contents of the 5GS Container. It is to be decided whether CT4 needs

      A GTP-U tunnel is used per PDU session to encapsulate T-PDUs and GTP-U signaling messages (e.g. End Marker, Echo

      A 5GS Container is defined as a new single GTP-U Extension Header over the N3 and N9 interfaces and the elements 
      are added to this container as they appear with the forthcoming features and releases. This approach would allow 
      to design the 5GS information elements independently from the tunneling protocol used within the 5GS, i.e. it would 
      achieve the separation of the Transport Network Layer (TNL) and Radio Network Layer (RNL) as required in <xref target="TR.38.801-3GPP"/> 
      subclause 7.3.2. This would allow to not impact the RNL if in a future release a new transport network layer (TNL) 
      other than GTP-U/UDP/IP (e.g. GRE/IP) was decided to be supported.

Legend:
o PDU layer: This layer corresponds to the PDU carried between the UE
    and the DN over the PDU session. When the PDU session Type is
    IPV6, it corresponds to IPv6 packets; When the PDU session Type
    is Ethernet, it corresponds to Ethernet frames; etc.
o GPRS Tunnelling Protocol for the user plane (GTP U): This protocol
    supports multiplexing traffic of different PDU sessions (possibly
    corresponding to different PDU session Types) by tunnelling user
    data over N3 (i.e. between the AN node and the UPF) in the
    backbone network. GTP shall encapsulate all end user PDUs. It
    provides encapsulation on a per PDU session level. This layer
    carries also the marking associated with a QoS Flow.
o 5G Encapsulation: This layer supports multiplexing traffic of
    different PDU sessions (possibly corresponding to different PDU
    session Types) over N9 (i.e. between different UPF of the 5GC).
    It provides encapsulation on a per PDU session level. This layer
    carries also the marking associated with a QoS Flow.

      <section title="Overview">
        <t>
        Segment Routing (SR), defined in [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing] generalises the source routing paradigm 
        with an ordered list of global and/or nodal instructions (segments) prepended in an SR header in order to 
        either steer traffic flows through the network while confining flow states to the ingress nodes in the SR 
        domains and/or to indicate functions that are performed at specific network locations.
        </t>
        
        <t>
        The IPV6 realisation of SR (SRV6) defines a SR Header (SRH), see <xref target="I-D.ietf-6man-segment-routing-header"/>. 
        SRV6 encodes segments as IPV6 addresses in the Segment List (SL) of its header. The packet destination address 
        in SRV6 specifies the active segment while an index field in the SRH points to the next active segment in the 
        list. The index field in SRH is decremented as SRV6 progressively forces packet flows through different segments 
        over the IPV6 data plane.
        </t>
        
        <t>
        The versatility and adaptability of SR combined with IPV6's ample and flexible address space positions SRV6 
        as a viable data path technology for the next generation of mobile user plane, in particular the 3GPP N9 (UPF to UPF).
        </t>
        
        <t>
        This section starts by summarising the use of SRV6 as a drop-in alternative for GTP-U over the N9 interface 
        connecting different User Plane Functions (UPF). It then shows how SRV6 as a GTP-U replacement can then provide 
        additional features such as TE, sparing, rate limiting, and service chaining that are not natively available by GTP. 
        </t>
        
        <t>
        The discussion then focuses on advanced routing with the Identifier/Locator paradigm and shows how SRV6 can be used 
        to realise this model in the mobile back-haul in either an anchored or anchorless mode of operation.
        </t>
        
        <t>
        SRV6 appears well placed as a mechanism to replace GTP-U with initially no control plane changes, but to then offer 
        a progressive path towards many innovations in routing.
        </t>
      </section>
      
      <section title="SRV6 as Drop-In Alternative for GTP-U">
        <t>
        Existing mobile back-haul employs GTP tunnels to carry user traffic flows in the network. These tunnels are unidirectional, 
        are established via the control plane for a particular QoS level, and run on links between access and the different anchor 
        nodes all the way to DN gateways. 3GPP uses the term UPF to refer to the variety of functions performing different tasks 
        on user traffic along the data path in 5G networks and suggests the use of GTP tunnels to carry user traffic between these 
        UPFs (N9 interface).
        </t>
        
        <t>
        The Tunnel Id (TEID) field in the GTP tunnel plays a crucial role in stitching the data path between the above mentioned 
        network nodes for a particular user flow. In other words, TEIDs are used to coordinate traffic hand off between different UPFs.
        </t>
        
        <t>
        In its most basic form, SRV6 can be used as a simple drop-in alternative for GTP tunnels. The control plane in this approach 
        remains the same, and still attempts to establish GTP-U tunnels and communicate TEIDs between the tunnel end points. However, 
        at the user plane, SRV6 capable nodes use SIDs to direct user traffic between the UPFs.
        </t>
        
        <t>
        The simplest option is to encapsulate the entire GTP frame as a payload within SRV6. However, this scheme still carries the 
        GTP header as the payload and as such doesn't offer significant advantage.
        </t>
        
        <t>
        A much more promising option however is to use SIDs to carry tunnel related information. Here, TEIDs and other relevant data 
        can be encoded into SRV6 SIDs which can be mapped back to TEID's at the intermediate UPFs thus requiring no changes except 
        at the encapsulation and de-encapsulation points in the UPF chains.
        </t>
        
        <t>
        <xref target="I-D.ietf-dmm-srv6-mobile-uplane"/> discusses the details of leveraging the existing control plane for distributing 
        GTP tunnel information between the end nodes and employing SRV6 in data plane for UPF connectivity. The document defines a SID 
        structure for conveying TEID, DA, and SA of GTP tunnels, shows how hybrid IPV4/IPV6 networks are supported by this model and in 
        doing so, it paves a migration path toward a full SRV6 data plane.
        </t>
        
        <t>
        Another alternative that can provide for a smooth migration toward SRV6 data plane between UPFs is via the use of "Tag", 
        and optional TLV fields in SRH. Similar to the previously described method, this approach takes advantage of the existing 
        control plane to deliver GTP tunnel information to the UPF endpoints. "Tag" and optional TLV fields in SRH are then used 
        to encode tunnel information in the SRV6 data plane where the UPFs can determine the TEID etc. by inverting the mapping.
        </t>
        
        <t>
        In yet another option, GTP tunnel information can be encoded as a separate SID either within the same SRH after the SID 
        that identifies the UPF itself (SRH-UPF)or inside a separate SRH (SRH-G). In this option, SID representing the GTP tunnel 
        information acts as both start and end point of a segment within the UPF. This option resembles the MPLS label stacking 
        mechanism which is widely used in different VPN scenarios.
        </t>
        
        <t>
        It must be noted that in any of the above mentioned approaches, the ingress UPF in SRV6 domain can insert a SRH containing 
        the list of SIDs that corresponds to all UPFs along the path. Alternatively, UPFs can stack a new SRH on top of the one 
        inserted by the previous one as packets traverse network paths between different pairs of UPFs in the network.

    <section title="SRV6 as Drop-In GTP Replacement with TE">
      <t>
      The previous section discussed using SRV6 as a drop-in replacement for GTP tunnels in existing mobile networks. 
      No new capabilities were introduced by this simple 1 to 1 replacement. We now explore additional possible features 
      once SRV6 has been introduced.
      </t>
      
      <t>
      Traffic engineering is an integral feature of SR. The SRV6 variant of SR of course supports both strict and loose 
      models of source routing. Here, the SID list in SRH can represent a loose or strict path to UPFs. Therefore, traffic 
      engineering can easily be supported regardless of any of the aforementioned approaches.
      </t>
      
      <t>
      For loose paths to UPFs, a set of one or more SIDs in SRH's SID list identifies on or more, but not all the 
      intermediate nodes to a particular UPF. Packets then follow the IGP shortest path through the network to each 
      specified intermediate node till they reach the target UPF.
      </t>
      
      <t>
      In the case of strict path to UPFs, SRH contains a set of SIDs representing all the intermediate nodes and links that 
      the packet must visit on its route to a particular UPF. The last SID in the set represents the target UPF itself or 
      the last link to this UPF. Here, SRV6 packet processing at each node invokes the function(s) that is associated with 
      SID[SL], the packet then receives the required treatment and gets forwarded over the SRH's specified path toward the 
      target UPF.
      </t>
      
      <t>
      It must be noted that the SRH could contain multiple sets of SIDs each representing a TE path between a pair of UPFs. 
      Alternatively, the SRH can contain a fully resolved end to end TE path that covers every intermediate node and UPF 
      along the data plane.
      </t>
      
      <t>
      SR considers segments to be instructions. Therefore each SID can represent a function that enforces a specific nodal 
      or global packet treatment. Attributes such as jitter and delay requirement, rate limiting factors, etc. can be easily 
      encoded in to SIDs in order to apply the desired treatment as packets traverse the network from UPF to UPF. 
      <xref target="I-D.ietf-dmm-srv6-mobile-uplane"/> suggests a SID encoding mechanism for rate limiting purposes. 
      </t>
      
      <t>

      programming concept, and a list of some of the main SR functions.

      </t>
    </section>
    
    <section title="UPF Chaining with SRV6">
      <t>
      Service or function chaining is another intrinsic feature of SR and its SRV6 derivative. Using this capability, 
      operators can direct user traffic through a set of UPFs where each UPF performs a specific task or executes certain 
      functions on the traffic.
      </t>
      
      <t>
      UPF chaining is achieved through the use of SIDs in SRV6 in the manner identical to what was described in the 
      previous section regarding SRV6 support for traffic engineering. 
      </t>
      
      <t>
      Generally speaking, the SRH is populated with a set of SIDs with each SID identifying a specific UPF in the network. 
      Starting from the ingress SRV6 node, packets are then forwarded through the network in either loose or explicit mode 
      toward each UPF.
      </t>
      
      <t>
      Please refer to <xref target="I-D.xuclad-spring-sr-service-chaining"/> for further detail.
      </t>
      
    </section>
    
    <section title="SRV6 and Entropy">
      <t>
      Ability to provide a good level of entropy is an important aspect of data plane protocols. The TEID field in GTP tunnels 
      if included in network node's hashing algorithms can result in good load balancing. Therefore, any new data plane proposal 
      should be able to deal with entropy in an efficient manner. 
      </t>
      
      <t>
      SRV6 SIDs can easily accommodate entropy at either hop by hop or global level via reserving a set of bits in the SID 
      construct itself; and hence, eliminate the need for a special entropy Segment ID in SRH. Here, the hashing algorithm at 
      different nodes distribute traffic flows based on the SID which has been copied to IPV6 DA field.
      </t>
      
      <t>
      Alternatively, entropy related information can be encoded as optional TLV field in SRV6's SRH.
      </t>
      
    </section>
    
    <section title="SRV6 and 5G Slicing">
      <t>
      Slicing is one of the main features in 5G [3GPP 23501]. Several Slices with different requirements can coexist on top of 
      the common network infrastructure. Diverse flows belonging to different 5G slices can be completely disjoint or can share 
      different parts of the network infrastructure. SRV6's native features such as TE, Chaining, one-plus-one protection, etc. 
      either in stand-alone or in conjunction with other alternatives for mobility support such as ID-LOC model lend themselves 
      well to 5G slicing paradigm.

      <section title="SRV6 and Locator/ID Separation Paradigm for N9 Interface">
        <t>
        The previous sections discussed how SRV6 could be employed as a replacement for GTP tunnels while leaving 
        the existing control plane intact. This section describes the use of SRV6 as a vehicle to implement Locator/ID 
        Separation model for UPF data plane connectivity.
        </t>
      </section>
      
      <section title="Brief Overview of Locator-ID Separation">
        <t>
        Traditional routing architecture uses IP addresses as both device identity and its location in the network. 
        Locator-ID Separation model establishes a paradigm in which a device identity and its network location are 
        split into two separate namespaces: End-point Identifiers (EID), and Route Locators (RLOC) that are correlated 
        via a control plane, or a dynamic (centralised or distributed) mapping system.
        </t>
        
        <t>
        RLOCs are tied to network topology. They represent network devices that are reachable via traditional routing. 
        EIDs, on the other hand, represent mobile or stationary devices, functions, etc. that are reachable via different 
        RLOCs based on the network location where they get instantiated, activated or moved.
        </t>
        
        <t>
        Using this model, as long as EID-RLOC relationship remains up to date, EIDs can easily move between the RLOCs. 
        That is the EID namespace can freely move without any impact to the routing paths and connectivity between the 
        Route Locators.
        </t>
        
        <t>
        This type of multi encapsulation and routing has been employed in fixed networks (IP, VPN, MPLS, etc.). The use 
        of this paradigm in mobile data plane, therefore, offers an approach that takes advantage of a mature and proven 
        technology to implement the N9 interface for UPF connectivity.
        </t>
      </section>
      
      <section title="Locator-ID Separation via SRV6 for UPF connectivity">
        <t>
        SRV6 can easily implement ID-LOC Separation model for UPF connectivity. The SIDs are once again the main vehicle here. 
        In this model, UPFs are considered to be the IDs while the nodes where the UPFs attach to take on the role of the Locators.
        Multiple UPFs are allowed to attach to the same Locator. It is also possible for a UPF to connect to multiple Locators. 
        There are several implementation options. The followings highlights a few possibilities.
        </t>
        
        <section title="Overlay model with SRV6 Locators">
        <t>
        In this approach, UPFs connect to SRV6 capable Locators. UPFs use IPV4/IPV6 transport either in conjunction with GTP or 
        without any GTP tunnel and send the packets to their associated Locator at the near end (Ingress SRV6 Locator).
        </t>
        
        <t>
        In either case, the ingress SRV6 Locator uses the DA field in arriving packets to identify the far end Locator 
        (Egress SRV6 Locator) where the target UPF is attached and obtains its associated SID. 
        </t>
        
        <t>
        For GTP encapsulated traffic from UPFs, the ingress SRV6 Locator must also deliver GTP information to the far end Locator. 
        Please see section 5.2. for more information on different methods of conveying GTP information in SRV6 domains. 
        </t>
        
        <t>
        The ingress SRV6 Locator then constructs the SRH and sends the traffic through the SRV6 network toward the egress RV6 Locator.
        Egress Locator marks the end of the segment and ships the traffic to the target UPF.
        </t>
        
        <t>
        It must be noted that use of GTP at UPFs allows us to leave the 3GPP control plane intact and hence provides a smooth migration 
        path toward SRV6 with ID-Locator model. For inter UPF traffic that doesn't use GTP, the control plane requires some modifications 
        in order to be able to convey endpoint information to interested parties.

        <section title="SRV6 Capable UPFs and RLOCs">
          <t>
          In this model, the head end UPF (Ingress UPF) is the ingress node and the entity that constructs 
          the SRH in the SRV6 domain. Here, both UPFs (IDs) and Locators are represented by SIDs in the SRH. 
          The SID list establishes either a partial or the full path to a target or a set of UPFs that traffic 
          is required to traverse.
          </t>
          
          <t>
          The 3GPP control plane is responsible for distributing UPF's endpoint information. But it requires 
          some modifications to be able to convey endpoint information to interested parties.
          </t>
          
          <t>
          In its simplest form, the SMF using policy information prepares a set of one or more UPFs along the 
          traffic path and distributes this set in the form a SID list to the ingress UPF. This SID list of UPFs 
          is then gets augmented with a set of SIDs identifying the Locators representing the current point of 
          attachment for each UPF along the data path. 
          </t>
          
          <t>
          Alternatively, the SMF can provide a fully resolved SID list by communicating with a centralised or 
          distributed ID-LOC mapping system containing all the relevant data regarding the UPF-Locator relationship. 
          </t>
          
          <t>
          In yet another approach, the SMF can provide a partial SID list representing the segment between each pair 
          of UPFs to individual UPFs along the path.
          </t>
          
          <t>
          Regardless of the approach, any changes to UPF's point of attachment must be reflected in the mapping 
          system and communicated to the SMF for distribution to the appropriate set of UPFs. Keeping the mapping 
          system current is essential to proper operation. As long as the mapping database is up-to-date, UPFs can 
          be easily moved in the network. Design of ID-Locator mapping system is beyond the scope of this document. 
          However, experiment with distributed mapping systems offered by today's public clouds has shown very 
          promising results which can be further improved and tailored to mobile network requirements.

        <section title="Advanced Features in ID-Locator Architecture">
          <t>
          SRV6's native features such as Traffic Engineering, QoS support, UPF Chaining, etc. can be easily added to 
          ID-Locator support. As it was noted earlier, these features are not readily available by GTP.

        </section>
        
      </section>
      
      <section title="Areas of Concerns">
      <t>
      Support for IPV6 is a precondition for SRV6. Although SRV6 can support hybrid IPV4/IPV6 mobile data plane through an 
      interworking node, support of UPFs with IPV4 address is rather complex.
      </t>
      
      <t>
      Due to IPV6 128-bit address space, large SRH size can have a negative impact on MTU. Large SRH size can also exert 
      undesirable header tax especially in the case of small payload size. Furthermore, compound SID processing at each node 
      might affect line rate.
      </t>
      
      <t>
      ID-LOC architecture relies on high performance mapping systems. Distributed mapping systems using some form Distributed 
      Hash Table(DHT) exhibit very promising results. But further investigation is required to ensure mobility requirements 
      in mobile data plane.

      LISP supports multi-homed shortest-path session survivable mobility. An EID can remain fixed for a node that roams while 
      its dynamic binding changes to the RLOCs it uses when it reconnect to the new network location.
      </t>
      
      <t>
      When the roaming node supports LISP, its EIDs and RLOCs are local to the node. This form of mobility is call LISP Mobile-Node. 
      Details can be found in <xref target="I-D.ietf-lisp-mn"/>.
      </t>
      
      <t>
      When the roaming node does not support LISP, but LISP runs in the network the node roams to, the EIDs and RLOCs are not 
      co-located in the same device. In this case, EIDs are assigned to the roaming node and RLOCs are assigned to LISP xTRs. 
      So when the roaming node attaches to the network, its EIDs are mapped to the RLOCs of the LISP xTRs in the network. 
      This form of mobility is called LISP EID-Mobility. Details can be found in <xref target="I-D.ietf-lisp-eid-mobility"/>.
      </t>
      
      <t>
      For a 3GGP mobile network, the LISP EID-Mobility form of mobility is recommended and is specified in the use-case document

      <t>
      In the LISP WG re-charter of 2016, consensus was reached to separate the data-plane and control-plane aspects of the protocol. 
      The current LISP control-plane (LISP-CP) specification <xref target="I-D.ietf-lisp-rfc6833bis"/> is data-plane agnostic and can 
      serve as control-plane for different data-plane protocols. In this section we describe how LISP-CP can serve to enable the 
      operation of an ILA data-plane. A similar approach can be followed to use LISP-CP as control-plane for other data-plane protocols 
      (e.g. VXLAN, SRv6, etc).

       <t>
       Please refer to Section 8 for description of the ILA data-plane. The complete specification of how to use the LISP-CP in conjunction 
       with an ILA data-plane can be found in <xref target="I-D.rodrigueznatal-ila-lisp"/>. Below are summarized the major points to take 
       into account when running LISP-CP as control-plane for ILA.
       <list style="symbols">
       <t>
       Leveraging on the flexible LISP-CP address encoding defined in <xref target="RFC8060"/>, different ILA address types are defined in 
       <xref target="I-D.rodrigueznatal-ila-lisp"/> to carry ILA metadata over the LISP-CP.
       </t>
       
       <t>
       XTRs can serve as both ILA-Ns (when their map-cache is incomplete) or ILA-Rs (when their map-cache is complete). XTRs serving as ILA-Rs 
       subscribe to the Mapping System to populate their map-cache with all the mappings in the domain (or its shard) using 
       <xref target="I-D.ietf-lisp-pubsub"/>.
       </t>
       
       <t>
       LISP-CP can run over TCP or UDP. The same signaling and logic applies independently of the transport. Additionally, when running over 
       TCP, the optimizations specified in <xref target="I-D.kouvelas-lisp-map-server-reliable-transport"/> can be applied.
       </t>
       
       <t>
       The ILA control-plane operations "request/response" and "push" are implemented via the LISP mechanisms defined in 
       <xref target="I-D.ietf-lisp-rfc6833bis"/> and <xref target="I-D.ietf-lisp-pubsub"/> respectively. When the Mapping System is 
       co-located with the XTRs serving as ILA-Rs, the ILA "redirect" operation is implemented via the mapping notifications described in 
       <xref target="I-D.ietf-lisp-pubsub"/>.
       </t>
       
       <t>
       XTRs serving as ILA-Ns can use LISP-CP as described in <xref target="I-D.ietf-lisp-rfc6833bis"/> to register and keep updated in the 
       Mapping System the information regarding their local mappings.
       </t>
       
       <t>
       When using ILA as data-plane, the mobility features and benefits discussed in Section 8 and in <xref target="I-D.ietf-lisp-eid-mobility"/> 
       still apply.
       </t>
       
       <t>
       As discussed in <xref target="I-D.rodrigueznatal-ila-lisp"/>, the LISP-CP can be used not only to resolve ID-Loc mappings but also to obtain 
       the ILA Identifier when it is not possible to locally derivate it from the endpoint address. These two mapping operations can be combined 
       into one to obtain the ILA Identifier and associated locators in a single round of signaling.

       ILA is a form of identifier/locator split where IPv6 addresses are transformed from application-visible, non-topological "identifier" 
       addresses to topological "locator" addresses. Locator addresses allow packets to be forwarded to the network location where a logical 
       or mobile node currently resides or is attached. Before delivery to the ultimate destination, locator addresses are reverse transformed 
       back to the original application visible addresses. ILA does address "transformation" as opposed to "translation" since address 
       modifications are always undone. ILA is conceptually similar to ILNP and 8+8, however ILA is contained in the network layer. It is not 
       limited to end node deployment, does not require any changes to transport layer protocols, and does not use extension headers.
       </t>
       
       <t>
       ILA includes both a data plane and control plane. The data plane defines the address structure and mechanisms for transforming 
       application visible identifier addresses to locator addresses. The control plane's primary focus is a mapping system that includes 
       a database of identifier to locator mappings. This mapping database drives ILA transformations. Control plane protocols disseminate 
       identifier to locator mappings amongst ILA nodes.
       </t>
       
       <t>
       The use cases of ILA include mobile networks, datacenter virtualization, and network virtualization. A recent trend in the industry 
       is to build converged networks containing all three of these to provide low latency and high availability. A single network overlay 
       solution that works across multiple use cases is appealing.

       <t>
       ILA is a proposed alternative to GTP-U and encapsulation. It does not require anchors and simplifies both the data plane and 
       control plane. ILA is a general network overlay protocol can be used to meet the requirements of use cases in a converged network. 
       User Plane Functions (UPF) with ILA are lightweight and stateless such that they can be brought up quickly as needed.
       </t>
       
       <t>
       <xref target="fig_ILA-in-5G-1"/> and <xref target="fig_ILA-in-5G-2"/> depict two architectural options for the use of ILA 
       in a 5G architecture. ILA is logically a network function and ILA interfaces to the 5G control plane via service based interfaces.
       </t>
       
       <t>
       In this architecture, ILA replaces GTP use over the N9 interface. Identifier address to locator address transformations 
       in the downlink from the data network are done by an ILA-R. Transformations for intra domain traffic can be done by an 
       ILA-N close to the gNB or by an ILA-R in the case of a cache miss. Locator address to identifier address transformation 
       happen at ILA-Ns.
       </t>
       
       <t>
       ILA could be supported on a gNB. In this case, an ILA-N would be co- resident at a gNB and ILA is used over N3 interface in lieu GTP-U.
       </t>
       
       <t>
       <xref target="fig_ILA-in-5G-2"/> and <xref target="fig_ILA-in-5G-3"/> depict two options of how ILA can be used in the 5G architecture. 
       The control plane functions can be implemented as standalone network functions or can be implemented with other network functions. 
       The control plane protocol can be implemented as enhancement to N4, as APIs or as independent protocol. 
       </t>
       
       <t>
       Use of ILA in roaming scenarios is still TBD.

      <t>
      ILA-M provides the interface between the 5G services architecture and the common ILA control plane.
      </t>
      
        <section title="ILA-M services interface">
        <t>
        The control interface into ILA is via an ILA-M that interacts with 5G network services. ILA-M uses RESTful 
        APIs to make requests to network services. An ILA-M receives notifications when devices enter the network, 
        leave it, or move within the network. The ILA-M writes the ILA mapping entries accordingly. 
        </t>
        
        <t>
        ILA is a consumer of several 5G network services. The service operations of interest to ILA are:
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>Nudm (Unified Data Management): Provides subscriber information.</t>
          <t>Nsmf (Service Managment Function): Provides information about PDU sessions.</t>
          <t>Namf (Core Access and Mobility Function): Provides notifications of mobility events.</t>
        </list>
        </t>
        
        </section>
        
        <section title="ILA control plane">
        <t>
        The ILA control plane is composed of mapping protocols that manage and disseminate information about the mapping database. 
        There are two levels of mapping protocols: one used by ILA routers that require the full set of ILA mappings for a domain, 
        and one used by ILA nodes that maintain a caches of mappings.
        </t>
        
        <t>
        The ILA mapping system is effectively a key/value datastore that maps identifiers to locators. The protocol for sharing 
        mapping information amongst ILA routers can thus be implemented by a distributed database <xref target="I-D.herbert-ila-ilamp"/>. ILA separates the 
        control plane from the data plane, so alternative control plane protocols may be used with a common data plane 
        <xref target="I-D.lapukhov-bgp-ila-afi"/>,<xref target="I-D.rodrigueznatal-ila-lisp"/>.
        </t>
        
        <t>
        The ILA Mapping Protocol <xref target="I-D.herbert-ila-ilamp"/> is used between ILA forwarding nodes and ILA mapping routers. The purpose of the protocol 
        is to populate and maintain the ILA mapping cache in forwarding nodes. ILAMP defines redirects, a request/response protocol, 
        and a push mechanism to populate the mapping table. Unlike traditional routing protocols that run over UDP, this protocol 
        is intended to be run over TCP and may be RPC oriented. TCP provides reliability, statefulness implied by established 
        connections, ordering, and security in the form of TLS. Secure redirects are facilitated by the use of TCP. RPC facilities 
        such REST, Thrift, or GRPC leverage widely deployed models that are popular in SDN.

      <section title="IP addressing">
      <t>
      ILA supports single address assignments as well as prefix assignments. ILA will also support strong privacy in addressing 
      [ADDRPRIV].
      </t>
      
        <section title="Singleton address assignment">
        <t>
        Singleton addresses can use a canonical 64/64 locator/identifier split. Singleton addresses can be assigned by DHCPv6.
        </t>
        </section>
        
        <section title="Network prefix assignment">
        <t>
        Prefix assignment can be done via SLAAC or DHCPv6-PD.
        </t>
        
        <t>
        To support /64 prefix assignment with ILA, the ILA identifier can be encoded in the upper sixty-four bits of an address. 
        A level of indirection is used so that ILA transforms the upper sixty four bits to contain both a locator and an index 
        into a locator (ILA-N) specific table. The entry in the table provides the original sixty-four bit prefix so that locator 
        to identifier address transformation can be done.
        </t>
        
        <t>
        As an example of this scheme, suppose network has a /24 prefix. The identifier address format for /64 assignment might be:

        <t>
        The IID part is arbitrarily assigned by the device, so that is ignored by ILA. All routing, lookups, and transformations 
        (excepting checksum neutral mapping) are based on the upper sixty-four bits.
        </t>
        
        <t>
        For identifier to locator address transformation, a lookup is done on the upper sixty-four bits. That returns a value 
        that contains a locator and a locator table index. The resulting packet format may be something like:
        </t>

<figure><artwork align="center"><![CDATA[

</figure>

        <t>
        The packet is forwarded and routed to the ILA-N addressed by locator (/44 route in this case). At the ILA forwarding node, 
        the locator index is used as a key to an ILA-N specific table that returns a 40 bit Identifier. This value is then written 
        in the packet do ILA to identifier address transformation thereby restoring the original destination address.
        </t>
        
        <t>
        The locator index is not globally unique, it is specific to each ILA-N. When a node attaches to an ILA-N, an index is 
        chosen so that the table is populated at the ILA-N and the ILA mapping includes the locator and index. When a node detaches 
        from on ILA, it's entry in the table is removed and the index can be reused after a hold-down period to allow stale mappings
        to be purged.

        <section title="Strong privacy addresses">
        <t>
        Note that when a /64 is assigned to UEs, the assigned prefix may become a persistent identifier for a device. This is a 
        potential privacy issue. [ADDPRIV] describes this problem and suggests some solutions that may be used with ILA.

      <section title="Traffic engineering">
      <t>
      ILA is primarily a mechanism for mobility and network virtualization. Transport mechanisms for traffic engineering such as 
      MPLS, network slices, encapsulation, routing based on flow hash(flow label) can be applied independently of ILA. This 
      separation allows any discussion related to transport to be left to operator deployment.
      </t>
      </section>
      
      <section title="Locator Chaining with ILA">
      <t>
      ILA transformations can be performed on a hop-by-hop bases. In this manner a packet can be source routed through a sequence 
      of nodes. At each hop a determination is made as to the next hop the packet should visit. The locator for the target is then 
      written into the destination. Eventually, the packet will be forwarded to an ILA forwarding node that will restore the original 
      address before delivery to the final destination.

      In this figure, slice #1 illustrates legacy use of UPFs without ILA in a slice. ILA can be deployed incrementally 
      or in parts of the network. As demonstrated, the use of network slices can provide domain isolation for this.
      </t>
      
      <t>
      Slice #2 supports ILA. Some number of ILA-Ns and ILA-Rs are deployed. ILA transformations are performed over the N9 
      interface. ILA-Rs would be deployed at the N6 interface to perform transformations on packets received from a data network. 
      ILA-Ns will be deployed deeper in the network at one side of the N3 interface. ILA-Ns may be supplemented by ILA-Rs that 
      are deployed in the network. ILA-M manages the ILA nodes and mapping database within the slice.
      </t>
      
      <t>
      Slice #3 shows another slice that supports ILA. In this scenario, the slice is for Mobile Edge Computing. The slice contains 
      ILA-Rs and ILA-Ns, and as illustrated, it may also contain ILA_Hs that run directly on edge computing servers. Note in this 
      example, one ILA-M, and hence one ILA domain, is shared between slice #2 and slice #3. Alternatively, the two slices could 
      each have their own ILA-M and define separate ILA domains.

      <section title="Security considerations">
      <t>
      A mobile public infrastructure has many considerations in security as well as privacy. Fundamentally, a system must protect 
      against misdirection for the purposes of hijacking traffic, spoofing, revealing user identities, exposing accurate geo-location, 
      and Denial of Service attacks on the infrastructure.
      </t>
      
      <t>
      The ILA mapping system contains personally identifiable information (PII) including user identities and geo-location. The 
      information must be safeguarded. An ILA domain is confined to one administrative domain, only trusted parties entities in 
      the domain participate in ILA. There is no concept of a global, public mapping system and UEs in public networks generally 
      do not participate in ILA protocols since they are untrusted. ILA control protocols, include ILA redirects, use TCP. TLS 
      or other protocols can be applied for strong security.
      </t>
      
      <t>
      Privacy in addressing is a consideration. ILA endeavors to provide a mechanism of address assignment that prevents inference 
      of user identity or location. This problem is described in [ADDRPRIV].

      <spanx style="strong">Locator-based architectures</spanx>
      </t>

      <t>
      IP communication relies solely on locators (host interfaces' addresses) that
      are also used as node/service identifiers at network layer. Such semantic
      overloading of IP addresses as both identifiers and locators does not allow to
      disentangle locators from location-independent traffic identifiers, thus
      complexifying mobility management.
      </t>

      <t>
      As a result, traffic anchors and tunnels have been introduced to handle
      mobility while preserving the identifier exposed to the transport layer.
      </t>

      <t>
      <spanx style="strong">Locator-ID separation architectures</spanx>
      </t>

      <t>
      To overcome the limitations of purely locator-based architectures, there have
      been proposed the so called "identifier/locator separation" (or Loc/ID split)
      schemes, using separate namespaces for identifiers and locators, and a mapping
      system allowing routers to bind them together.
      </t>

      <t>
      Loc/ID split has been originally proposed by LISP, and is central to ILSR and
      ILNP proposals. The other approaches reviewed in this document, namely ILA, or
      the SRv6 proposal, also falls in the same category and share the requirements of
      a mapping system. This service can be centralized/decentralized or distributed where a
      correspondence of ID and locators is stored and updated upon changes.
      </t>

      <t>
      <spanx style="strong">ID-based architectures</spanx>
      </t>

      <t>
      A third class of approaches exists that redefines IP communication principles
      (i.e. network and transport layers) around location-independent identifiers
      <xref target="I-D.vonhugo-5gangip-ip-issues"/>.
      </t>

      <t>
      The work done around Information-Centric Networking (ICN)
      falls into such class of approaches that we refer to as purely ID-based, also
      known as name-based <xref target="I-D.irtf-icnrg-terminology"/>, and whose properties
      especially for mobility management we focus on in the rest of the section.
      </t>

    </section>
    
    <section anchor="benefits" title="Benefits">

      <t>
      The appeal of purely ID-based architectures is that they move Loc/ID
      split one step further by embedding ID-awareness in the network and transport
      layer by default and as such completely decoupling data delivery from
      underlying network connectivity. Forwarding is performed directly based on
      identifiers stored in routers' FIBs and no mapping of ID into locators is
      required. In this way, purely ID-based architectures remove the need to
      maintain a global mapping system at scale, and its intrinsic management
      complexity.
      </t>

      <t>
      Additional benefits brought specifically by ICN principles motivate the
      consideration of ICN solutions for next generation mobility architectures, e.g.
      </t>

      <t>
      <list style="symbols">
        <t>
        the flexibility of multi-source/multi-path connectionless pull-based
        transport. An example is the native support for consumer mobility, i.e. the
        transparent emission of data requests over multiple and varying available
        network interfaces during node mobility;
        </t>
      
        <t>
        the opportunity to define fine-grained per-application forwarding and
        security policies.

      management resulting from name-based forwarding can be found in <xref target="RFC7476"/>.

      <section anchor="hybrid-information-centric-networking-hicn" title="Hybrid Information-Centric Networking (hICN)">
      
      <t>
      Hybrid ICN (hICN) is an ICN architecture that defines integration of ICN
      semantics within IPv6, instead of over/under/aside. The only
      difference w.r.t. ICN as defined in <xref target="I-D.irtf-icnrg-ccnxsemantics"/> is that it
      encodes names inside IP addresses, and thus can use RFC-compliant TCP/IP
      packets to transport ICN semantics.
      </t>

      <t>
      The goal of hICN is to ease ICN insertion in existing IP infrastructure by:
      </t>

      <t>
      <list style="numbers">
        <t>
        selective insertion of hICN capabilities in a few network nodes at the edge
        (no need for pervasive fully hICN network enablement);
        </t>
        
        <t>
        guaranteed transparent interconnection with hICN-unaware IP nodes, without
        using overlays;
        </t>
        
        <t>
        minor modification to existing IP routers/endpoints (e.g. reuse of IP FIBs
        and of existing buffers, no modifications to L7 applications and user space hICN
        transport layer introduction in endpoints);
        </t>
        
        <t>
        re-use of existing IP control plane (e.g. for routing of IP prefixes carrying
        ID-semantics) along with performing mobility management and caching operations
        in forwarding plane;
        </t>
        
        <t>
        fallback capability to traditional IP network/transport layer.
        </t>
      
      </list>
      </t>

      <t>
      hICN architecture is described in detail in <xref target="I-D.muscariello-intarea-hicn"/>.
      Hereafter we focus on mobility management in hICN and on the possible
      deployment options for insertion in 5G SBA.

      </section>
      
      <section anchor="hicn-based-mobility" title="hICN-based mobility">

      <t>
      In ICN and hICN endpoints can act as consumers and/or producers. Consumers when they
      emit requests for named data packets (so called Interests), producers when they
      send data packets in response to consumers request (pull-based transport
      model).
      </t>

      <t>
      Clearly a node can be a consumer and a producer at the same time (e.g. in a
      voice conversation).
      </t>

      <t>
      Consumer and producer mobility are handled in a different way due to
      the pull-based request model. More specifically, consumer mobility is natively
      supported: consumers pull traffic by sending Interest packets towards
      named content (wherever produced/stored, the source is a priori unknown by the
      consumer). Interests are named-based forwarded using the information found in
      traversed routers' FIBs.
      </t>

      <t>
      In case of consumer mobility, i.e. mobility of the endpoint issuing the
      requests, selection of a new available output interface and retransmission of
      not-yet-satisfied Interests is sufficient for data delivery to continue,
      independently from the underlying change of locators. Consumer mobility is
      fully anchorless with hICN, and does not incur any signalization nor tunneling
      overhead.
      </t>
      
      <t>
      Producer mobility is not natively supported by ICN architecture, rather handled
      in different ways according to the selected producer mobility management
      scheme.
      </t>
      
      <t>
      In <xref target="I-D.irtf-icnrg-mapme"/> and <xref target="MAPME"/> producer mobility schemes are
      classified into four classes:
      </t>
      
      <t>
      <list style="symbols">
        <t>
        <spanx style="emph">Resolution based</spanx> solutions rely on dedicated rendez-vous nodes (similar to
        DNS) which map content names into routable location identifiers. To maintain
        this mapping updated, the producer signals every movement to the mapping system.
        Once the resolution is performed, packets can be correctly routed directly to
        the producer.
        </t>
        
        <t>
        <spanx style="emph">Anchor-based</spanx> proposals are inspired by Mobile IP, and maintain a mapping at
        network-layer by using a stable home address advertised by a rendez-vous node,
        or anchor. This acts as a relay, forwarding through tunneling both interests
        to the producer, and data packets coming back.
        </t>
        
        <t>
        <spanx style="emph">Tracing-based</spanx> solutions allow the mobile node to create a hop-by-hop
        forwarding reverse path from its RV back to itself by propagating and keeping
        alive traces stored by all involved routers. Forwarding to the new location is
        enabled without tunneling.
        </t>
        
        <t>
        <spanx style="emph">Anchorless</spanx> approaches allow the mobile nodes to advertise their
        mobility to the network without requiring any specific node to act as a
        rendez-vous point.</t>
      </list>
      </t>
      
      <t>
      The selected mobility management scheme for hICN is MAP-Me, an anchorless
      producer mobility management solution originally proposed for ICN
      <xref target="I-D.irtf-icnrg-mapme"/> <xref target="MAPME"/> and further extended to hICN in
      <xref target="I-D.auge-hicn-mobility"/>.
      </t>
      
      <t>
      MAP-Me belongs to the class of anchorless approaches that relies on
      scope-limited forwarding updates triggered by producer mobility events to keep
      locally up-to-date FIB information for a low-latency guaranteed reroute of
      consumer Interests towards changing location of the producer.
      </t>
      
      <t>
      The difference w.r.t. to other classes of approaches is that it does not
      require an anchor neither in forwarding plane (traffic does not need to pass
      through a specific network node), nor in the control plane (no rendez-vous
      point, no mapping system).
      </t>
      
      <t>
      As detailed in <xref target="I-D.auge-hicn-mobility"/> using MAP-Me, hICN provides
      anchorless consumer and producer mobility removing the need for tunnels and for
      ID mapping.
      </t>
      
      <t>
      Signaling of mobility is only required upon producer movements and limited in
      scope to current-to-previous network hops. Unlike routing updates, it is not
      necessary to update all routers' FIBs after a node has moved, but only those
      located on the path between the new and a former position of the producer.
      MAP-Me realizes this process in a distributed fashion through in-band signaling
      packets, hence its anchorless property with respect to the control plane too.
      Scalability of producer mobility is guaranteed by an efficient and secure FIB
      update process with minimal and bounded path stretch.
      </t>
      
      <t>
      Forwarding and mobility management operations in hICN are based only
      location-independent identifiers, preserving coexistence with IP locators whose
      existence may be required by non-hICN services and by control/management plane
      operations specific to the considered network architecture. As an example, in
      the case of 3GPP architectures, MAP-Me mobility management does not require an
      additional control plane anchor.
      </t>

      <section anchor="hicn-insertion-in-the-3gpp-5g-architecture" title="hICN insertion in the 3GPP 5G architecture">

      <t>
      <xref target="I-D.auge-hicn-mobility-deployment-options"/> reviews various insertion
      strategies for hICN, including overlay deployments using local breakout to hICN
      instances situated in MEC, or hICN forwarders deployed within an UPF. While
      those approaches have the merit of allowing an easy or early integration of hICN
      and exploiting some of its benefits, they do not fully exploit purely ID-based
      capabilities nor the dynamic hICN forwarding.
      </t>
      
      <t>
      Thus, in this section, we focus our attention on more integrated approaches
      leveraging hICN-enriched mobile backhaul network to offer an alternative to
      GTP-U tunnels over the N9 (and possibly N3) Interfaces, as shown in
      <xref target="fig_3GPP-5GS-SBA"/> and <xref target="fig_Protocol-Stack"/>.
      </t>
      
      <section anchor="control-plane-considerations" title="Control plane considerations">
      
      <t>
      By operating directly on routers' FIBs for mobility updates, dynamic hop-by-hop
      forwarding strategies etc., hICN inherits the simplicity of IP forwarding and
      reuses IP routing protocols for ID prefixes advertisement and routing.  In this
      way it removes the challenges of managing a distributed mapping service at scale
      (cache update/refresh, etc.).  In addition it remains compatible with the
      exiting control plane architecture as proposed in the 3GPP standard, with no
      change required to N1, N2 or N4.
      </t>

      <t>
      MAP-Me anchorless producer mobility management does not imply SMF interaction,
      but does not exclude neither to use SMF signaling to trigger MAP-Me updates
      or to handle FIB updates, at the condition to follow the same procedure
      described for MAP-Me. However, the absence of SMF interaction might be
      beneficial in case of dense deployments or failure of the central control
      entities (infrastructure-less communication scenarios) to empower distributed
      control of local mobility within an area.

      Replacing only the N9 interface (which represents the interface between UPFs,

      IPv6 PDU layer, transported over N9 directly over L2.

      <section anchor="enhanced-data-plane-hicnsrv6-combination" title="Enhanced data plane: hICN/SRv6 combination">

      <t>
      hICN is designed to operate inside an IPv6 network by means
      of an enriched communication layer supporting ICN primitives. The targeted
      deployment of a few hICN-empowered nodes leads to the tradeoff between
      incremental deployment and benefits which are proportionally related to the
      degree of hICN penetration. The association of hICN with other data planes
      technologies is investigated as a possibility to overcome the above-mentioned
      tradeoff yielding to a selective, yet fully beneficial insertion of hICN in IP
      networks.
      </t>

      <t>
      To this aim, we focus on hICN insertion in a Segment Routing (SR) enhanced data
      plane, specifically considering SRv6 instantiation of SR. More details are
      provided in <xref target="I-D.auge-hicn-mobility-deployment-options"/>.
      </t>

      <t>
      hICN/SRv6 combination inherits all SRv6 advantages presented in SR-dedicated
      section of this document, namely "underlay" management (fast reroute, etc.),
      service chaining or fine-grained TE for instance.
      </t>

      <t>
      In addition, it allows extending the reach of hICN on regular IP routers with
      SRv6 functionality. One realization being to create SRv6 domains in between hICN
      nodes. The hICN router (through forwarding strategies) would then act as a
      control plane for SRv6 by specifying the list of SIDs to insert in the packet.
      </t>

      <t>
      SRv6 forwarding of packets between hICN hops would allow to enforce dynamic
      per-application hICN forwarding strategies and their objectives (path steering,
      QoS, etc.), which would be otherwise not possible over not hICN-enabled IP
      network segments. It would also allow dynamic multi-path and load balancing in
      hICN-unaware IP network segments and it could guarantee request/reply IP path
      symmetry (instrumental for efficient round trip delay measurements and
      rate/congestion control).

      <t>
      Benefits of the deployed solution result both from the purely identifier-based

      expected benefits, described in more detail with examples in
      <xref target="I-D.auge-hicn-mobility-deployment-options"/>.

      <t>
      The ability to satisfy UE requests close to the access is important for
      latency-sensitive applications such as AR/VR and for cost-efficient transport
      (that minimizes high-throughput traffic carrying to the core when it can be
      satisfied locally).
      </t>

      <t>
      In addition, hICN ability to serve requests from cache or to aggregate them
      implicitly realizes opportunistic multicast distribution of popular content
      improving users' QoE for service such as VoD or live streaming, while greatly
      offloading the mobile core.

        <t>Consumer mobility improvements</t>

      </t>

      <t>
      The combined use of identifiers and a pull-model allows for seamless mobility
      across heterogeneous wired and wireless networks, as well as their simultaneous
      use for multi-homing and bandwidth aggregation. A specific feature of hICN
      is to allow the use of multiple path/sources of content at the same
      time, for instance edge caches located at the edge of different fixed/mobile
      network accesses.

      <t>
      On-path insertion of hICN enables the use of network buffers to optimize traffic
      engineering including multipath and load balancing support. One interesting
      deployment consists in enabling hICN in the PDU Session Anchor, so as to allow
      two downstream paths back to the mobile edge (due to hICN replacing the datagram
      source address by the locator of the output UPF), thereby exploiting additional
      upstream path diversity / resiliency. The ability to perform in-network
      assistance (for rate/loss/congestion control) is an additional advantage, e.g.
      to support rate adaptation in the case of dynamic adaptive streaming, or to
      improve reliability of WiFi connection through transparent wireless detection
      and recovery <xref target="WLDR"/>.

      <t>
      Removing N9 tunnels is key to allow a fully anchorless solution, by not forcing
      all traffic to transit through the anchoring point in the core. Local forwarding
      decisions will allow the offloading of device-to-device communications when the
      different UEs are topologically close, as well as network operations when some

        <t>Removal of tunnel management state and signaling</t>
      </list>
      </t>

      <t>
      The clear advantage is the complete removal of tunnels. Forwarding beyond the
      radio access is directly managed through hICN. As a consequence, no additional
      state nor signaling is required for static and mobile consumers, nor for static
      producers. The impact of producer mobility is low because of the small number of
      impacted routers.
      </t>

      <t>
      Deploying hICN on both N3 and N9 further presents the advantage of removing the
      need for inter-networking with remaining GTP tunnels between those two
      interfaces. The result is a simpler and lighter architecture, allowing
      convergence with other non-3GPP accesses.

        <t>Dynamic first UPF selection</t>

      </t>

      <t>
      Dynamic forwarding capabilities are extended in this configuration to the
      selection of the first UPF, with the potential of additional performance
      improvement and higher traffic offload because of the deployment of hICN
      functionalities closer to the UE. A significant advantage arises in dense
      deployments scenarios where it becomes possible to isolate the core network from
      the locally-management mobility (a design objective of the mobile architecture),
      while allowing distributed selection of ingress UPFs, and dynamic per-packet
      load balancing of traffic across them.
      </t>

      </section>

      <section anchor="deployment-considerations" title="Deployment considerations">
      
      <t>
      The benefits previously described can be obtained by an upgrade of only a few
      selected routers at the network edge. The design of hICN allows the rest of the\
      infrastructure to remain unmodified, and to leverage existing management and
      monitoring tools.
      </t>

        <section anchor="hicn-in-a-slice" title="hICN in a slice">

        <t>
        The use of hICN does not impose any specific slicing of the network. Rather, it
        can assist a transition of services towards hICN, and/or the coexistence of
        different hICN deployment options.
        </t>

        <t>
        As an example of use of hICN in a slice, a service provider might for instance
        decide to use an hICN-enabled slice dedicated to video delivery, with
        appropriate mobility management, and dedicated hICN nodes with appropriate
        caching/forwarding strategies at places aggregating considerable number of user
        requests.

        <section anchor="end-to-end-deployment" title="End-to-end deployment">

        <t>
        The deployment of an hICN stack in endpoints is the preferred option and offers
        the full range of benefits. The hICN network stack and forwarder are available
        through two reference implementations based on the CICN project <xref target="CICN"/>. They
        share an objective of smooth deployment in existing devices, and are fully
        userland based. The first is built on top of existing IP primitives and proposed
        as an application/library for all major OS vendors including iOS, Android, Linux
        and Windows. The second targets high-performance routers and servers, and
        leverages the VPP kernel-bypass technology.

        <section anchor="network-contained-deployment" title="Network-contained deployment">
        
        <t>
        It is not always possible nor desirable to affect endpoints, and a
        deployment fully contained in the network, or within the N9 interface is
        possible through the deployment of proxies. An overview of different options
        implemented at the network, transport or application level are considered. An
        example would be the deployment of HTTP proxies at the ingress and egress (resp.
        first and last UPFs), in order to benefit from content awareness in the network.
        Such configuration however reduces the flexibility and dynamic forwarding
        capabilities in endpoints. In particular, existing transport protocols have
        limited support for dynamically changing paths or network conditions.
        </t>
        
        <t>Traffic that is not handled though hICN mechanisms can still benefit from the
        lower overhead and anchorless mobility capabilities coming from the removal of
        GTP tunnels, as well as dynamic forwarding capabilities that are inherent to the
        forwarding pipeline. This results from the ability to assign
        location-independent identifiers to endpoints. It preserves the advantage of
        removing the mapping system, and of a lightweight FIB update process. No
        encapsulation is required and packet headers are not modified, which allows the
        network to have visibility in the source and/or destination identifiers.

      <t>
      hICN proposes a general purpose architecture that combines the benefits of a
      pure-ID architecture with those of ICN. While a full deployment is recommended
      to make efficient use of available network resources, it is still possible to
      opt for a partial or phased deployment, with the associated tradeoffs that we
      have reviewed here.
      </t>

      <t>
      An hICN enabled network offers native offloading capabilities thanks to the
      anchorless properties resulting from the pure-ID communication scheme. It does
      so without the need for a third party mapping system, and further requires no
      change in the 5G architecture nor in its control plane. The architecture will
      further leverage the incremental insertion of information centric
      functionalities through proxies or direct insertion in user devices as the
      technology gets adopted and deployed.

      <section title="Overview of the Low Impact Approach">
      <t>
      ID-Locator separation architecture can be implemented by control plane of a dedicated protocol such as LISP, ILNP, ILA, etc., 
      however, it may cause major impact to the specifications of 3GPP 5GS. This approach, described in 
      <xref target="I-D.homma-dmm-5gs-id-loc-coexistence"/>, enables to introduce such ID-Locator separation protocols into 5GS 
      with no or low impacts. It would also support a migration path toward a network which an ID-Locator separation protocol is 
      completely incorporated.
      </t>
      
      <t>
      This approach establishes an individual domain/slice in which an ID-Locator separation protocol works as packet forwarding 
      mechanism, and divert appropriate packets to the domain by using Up-Link Classifier (ULCL) which is a fundamental function 
      of UPF. An overview of this architecture is shown in <xref target="fig_Overview-ID-LOC-with-Low-Impact"/>.

      LOC-node is a node which has a locator and forwards packets to appropriate destination based on looking up of destination ID. 
      It is defined as xTR in LISP, and defined ILA-Node in ILA. Mapping System manages IDs of end points (e.g., UE, NF in dDN)

      GTP-U or any forwarding protocol described in this document can be used as data plane mechanism of this approach. 
      However, each LOC-Node must be connected to the all other LOC-Nodes and thus it may cause complexity of path management

      A control plane of every dedicated ID-Locator separation protocol described in this document can be used for this approach. 
      For management of mobility of UEs in ID-Locator separation domain, some cooperation between SMF and mapping system is needed. 
      In this approach, a UE is attached to a LOC-Node only when it communicates to another UE or an NF in a dDN. In 5GS, 
      SMF manages sessions, and thus SMF may be required to update mapping database when an UE moves to under another UPF or an NF 
      is moved to another dDN. The impact caused by such cooperation can be reduced by using Naf interface which is defined in 5GS 
      specifications.

          <t>
          This document presents considerations related to open issues with upcoming new communication systems denoted as 5G aiming to 
          set a basis for documenting problem space, use-cases, and potential solutions related to next-generation network infrastructure.  
          The draft reviews currently investigated topics, including both inputs from IETF and from other SDOs as well as research activities. 
          Further the outcome of recent discussions at side sessions during IETF meetings are recaptured to help identifying a starting point 
          for future thoughts.</t>
