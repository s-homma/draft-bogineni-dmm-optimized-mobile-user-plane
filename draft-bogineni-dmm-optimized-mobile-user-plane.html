<p id="rfc.section.3.p.9">The following information is sent in an encapsulation header over the N3 interface. N9 needs to support that.</p>
<pre>
- QFI (QoS Flow Identifier), see subclause 5.7.1 of 3GPP TS 23.501:

    "A QoS Flow ID (QFI) is used to identify a QoS flow in the 5G system. User Plane traffic with the same QFI within a PDU session receives the same traffic forwarding treatment (e.g. scheduling, admission threshold). The QFI is carried in an encapsulation header on N3 (and N9) i.e. without any changes to the e2e packet header. It can be applied to PDUs with different types of payload, i.e. IP packets, non-IP PDUs and Ethernet frames. The QFI shall be unique within a PDU session." The QFI is sent for both downlink and uplink user plane traffic.


- RQI (Reflective QoS Identifier), see subclause 5.7.5.4.2 of 3GPP TS
23.501:

    "When the 5GC determines to activate reflective QoS via U-plane, the SMF
    shall include a QoS rule including an indication to the UPF via N4
    interface to activate User Plane with user plane reflective. When the
    UPF receives a DL packet matching the QoS rule that contains an
    indication to activate reflective QoS, the UPF shall include the RQI in
    the encapsulation header on N3 reference point. The UE creates a UE
    derived QoS rule when the UE receives a DL packet with a RQI." The RQI
    is sent for downlink user plane traffic only.

- Support of RAN initiated QoS Flow mobility, when using Dual connectivity,
also requires the QFI to be sent within End Marker packets. See subclause
5.11.1 of 3GPP TS 23.501 and subclause 4.14.1 of 3GPP TS 23.502
respectively:

    - " For some other PDU sessions of an UE: Direct the DL User Plane
    traffic of some QoS flows of the PDU session to the Secondary
    (respectively Master) RAN Node while the remaining QoS flows of the PDU
    session are directed to the Master (respectively Secondary) RAN Node. In
    this case there are, irrespective of the number of QoS Flows, two N3
    tunnel terminations at the RAN for such PDU session."

    - " In order to assist the reordering function in the Master RAN node
    and/or Secondary RAN node, for the QFIs that are switched between Master
    RAN node and Secondary RAN node, the UPF sends one or more "end marker"
    packets along with QFI on the old tunnel immediately after switching the
    tunnel for the QFI. The UPF starts sending downlink packets to the
    Target RAN."

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.5.1.p.1">Segment Routing (SR), defined in <a href="#I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing" class="xref">[I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing]</a> generalises the source routing paradigm with an ordered list of global and/or nodal instructions (segments) prepended in an SR header in order to either steer traffic flows through the network while confining flow states to the ingress nodes in the SR domains and/or to indicate functions that are performed at specific network locations.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.1.p.2">The IPV6 realisation of SR (SRV6) defines a SR Header (SRH), see <a href="#I-D.ietf-6man-segment-routing-header" class="xref">[I-D.ietf-6man-segment-routing-header]</a>. SRV6 encodes segments as IPV6 addresses in the Segment List (SL) of its header. The packet destination address in SRV6 specifies the active segment while an index field in the SRH points to the next active segment in the list. The index field in SRH is decremented as SRV6 progressively forces packet flows through different segments over the IPV6 data plane.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.1.p.3">The versatility and adaptability of SR combined with IPV6&#8217;s ample and flexible address space positions SRV6 as a viable data path technology for the next generation of mobile user plane, in particular the 3GPP N9 (UPF to UPF).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.1.p.4">This section starts by summarising the use of SRV6 as a drop-in alternative for GTP-U over the N9 interface connecting different User Plane Functions (UPF). It then shows how SRV6 as a GTP-U replacement can then provide additional features such as TE, sparing, rate limiting, and service chaining that are not natively available by GTP.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.1.p.5">The discussion then focuses on advanced routing with the Identifier/Locator paradigm and shows how SRV6 can be used to realise this model in the mobile back-haul in either an anchored or anchorless mode of operation.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.1.p.6">SRV6 appears well placed as a mechanism to replace GTP-U with initially no control plane changes, but to then offer a progressive path towards many innovations in routing.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.5.2">
<a href="#rfc.section.5.2">5.2.</a> <a href="#srv6-as-drop-in-alternative-for-gtp-u" id="srv6-as-drop-in-alternative-for-gtp-u">SRV6 as Drop-In Alternative for GTP-U</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.5.2.p.1">Existing mobile back-haul employs GTP tunnels to carry user traffic flows in the network. These tunnels are unidirectional, are established via the control plane for a particular QoS level, and run on links between access and the different anchor nodes all the way to DN gateways. 3GPP uses the term UPF to refer to the variety of functions performing different tasks on user traffic along the data path in 5G networks and suggests the use of GTP tunnels to carry user traffic between these UPFs (N9 interface).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.2.p.2">The Tunnel Id (TEID) field in the GTP tunnel plays a crucial role in stitching the data path between the above mentioned network nodes for a particular user flow. In other words, TEIDs are used to coordinate traffic hand off between different UPFs.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.2.p.3">In its most basic form, SRV6 can be used as a simple drop-in alternative for GTP tunnels. The control plane in this approach remains the same, and still attempts to establish GTP-U tunnels and communicate TEIDs between the tunnel end points.  However, at the user plane, SRV6 capable nodes use SIDs to direct user traffic between the UPFs.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.2.p.4">The simplest option is to encapsulate the entire GTP frame as a payload within SRV6. However, this scheme still carries the GTP header as the payload and as such doesn&#8217;t offer significant advantage.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.2.p.5">A much more promising option however is to use SIDs to carry tunnel related information. Here, TEIDs and other relevant data can be encoded into SRV6 SIDs which can be mapped back to TEID&#8217;s at the intermediate UPFs thus requiring no changes except at the encapsulation and de-encapsulation points in the UPF chains.</p>
<p><a href="#I-D.ietf-dmm-srv6-mobile-uplane" class="xref">[I-D.ietf-dmm-srv6-mobile-uplane]</a> discusses the details of leveraging the existing control plane for distributing GTP tunnel information between the end nodes and employing SRV6 in data plane for UPF connectivity. The document defines a SID structure for conveying TEID, DA, and SA of GTP tunnels, shows how hybrid IPV4/IPV6 networks are supported by this model and in doing so, it paves a migration path toward a full SRV6 data plane.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.2.p.7">Another alternative that can provide for a smooth migration toward SRV6 data plane between UPFs is via the use of &#8220;Tag&#8221;, and optional TLV fields in SRH.  Similar to the previously described method, this approach takes advantage of the existing control plane to deliver GTP tunnel information to the UPF endpoints.  &#8220;Tag&#8221; and optional TLV fields in SRH are then used to encode tunnel information in the SRV6 data plane where the UPFs can determine the TEID etc. by inverting the mapping.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.2.p.8">In yet another option, GTP tunnel information can be encoded as a separate SID either within the same SRH after the SID that identifies the UPF itself (SRH-UPF)or inside a separate SRH (SRH-G). In this option, SID representing the GTP tunnel information acts as both start and end point of a segment within the UPF. This option resembles the MPLS label stacking mechanism which is widely used in different VPN scenarios.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.2.p.9">It must be noted that in any of the above mentioned approaches, the ingress UPF in SRV6 domain can insert a SRH containing the list of SIDs that corresponds to all UPFs along the path. Alternatively, UPFs can stack a new SRH on top of the one inserted by the previous one as packets traverse network paths between different pairs of UPFs in the network.</p>

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.5.3.p.1">The previous section discussed using SRV6 as a drop-in replacement for GTP tunnels in existing mobile networks. No new capabilities were introduced by this simple 1 to 1 replacement. We now explore additional possible features once SRV6 has been introduced.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.3.p.2">Traffic engineering is an integral feature of SR. The SRV6 variant of SR of course supports both strict and loose models of source routing. Here, the SID list in SRH can represent a loose or strict path to UPFs. Therefore, traffic engineering can easily be supported regardless of any of the aforementioned approaches.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.3.p.3">For loose paths to UPFs, a set of one or more SIDs in SRH&#8217;s SID list identifies on or more, but not all the intermediate nodes to a particular UPF. Packets then follow the IGP shortest path through the network to each specified intermediate node till they reach the target UPF.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.3.p.4">In the case of strict path to UPFs, SRH contains a set of SIDs representing all the intermediate nodes and links that the packet must visit on its route to a particular UPF. The last SID in the set represents the target UPF itself or the last link to this UPF. Here, SRV6 packet processing at each node invokes the function(s) that is associated with SID[SL], the packet then receives the required treatment and gets forwarded over the SRH&#8217;s specified path toward the target UPF.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.3.p.5">It must be noted that the SRH could contain multiple sets of SIDs each representing a TE path between a pair of UPFs. Alternatively, the SRH can contain a fully resolved end to end TE path that covers every intermediate node and UPF along the data plane.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.3.p.6">SR considers segments to be instructions. Therefore each SID can represent a function that enforces a specific nodal or global packet treatment. Attributes such as jitter and delay requirement, rate limiting factors, etc. can be easily encoded in to SIDs in order to apply the desired treatment as packets traverse the network from UPF to UPF. <a href="#I-D.ietf-dmm-srv6-mobile-uplane" class="xref">[I-D.ietf-dmm-srv6-mobile-uplane]</a> suggests a SID encoding mechanism for rate limiting purposes.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.6.2.1.p.1">The previous sections discussed how SRV6 could be employed as a replacement for GTP tunnels while leaving the existing control plane intact. This section describes the use of SRV6 as a vehicle to implement Locator/ID Separation model for UPF data plane connectivity.</p>

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.6.2.2.p.1">Traditional routing architecture uses IP addresses as both device identity and its location in the network. Locator-ID Separation model establishes a paradigm in which a device identity and its network location are split into two separate namespaces: End-point Identifiers (EID), and Route Locators (RLOC) that are correlated via a control plane, or a dynamic (centralised or distributed) mapping system.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.2.2.p.2">RLOCs are tied to network topology. They represent network devices that are reachable via traditional routing. EIDs, on the other hand, represent mobile or stationary devices, functions, etc. that are reachable via different RLOCs based on the network location where they get instantiated, activated or moved.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.2.2.p.3">Using this model, as long as EID-RLOC relationship remains up to date, EIDs can easily move between the RLOCs. That is the EID namespace can freely move without any impact to the routing paths and connectivity between the Route Locators.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.2.2.p.4">This type of multi encapsulation and routing has been employed in fixed networks (IP, VPN, MPLS, etc.). The use of this paradigm in mobile data plane, therefore, offers an approach that takes advantage of a mature and proven technology to implement the N9 interface for UPF connectivity.</p>

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.6.2.3.p.1">SRV6 can easily implement ID-LOC Separation model for UPF connectivity. The SIDs are once again the main vehicle here. In this model, UPFs are considered to be the IDs while the nodes where the UPFs attach to take on the role of the Locators. Multiple UPFs are allowed to attach to the same Locator. It is also possible for a UPF to connect to multiple Locators. There are several implementation options. The followings highlights a few possibilities.</p>

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.6.2.3.1.p.1">In this approach, UPFs connect to SRV6 capable Locators. UPFs use IPV4/IPV6 transport either in conjunction with GTP or without any GTP tunnel and send the packets to their associated Locator at the near end (Ingress SRV6 Locator).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.2.3.1.p.2">In either case, the ingress SRV6 Locator uses the DA field in arriving packets to identify the far end Locator (Egress SRV6 Locator) where the target UPF is attached and obtains its associated SID.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.2.3.1.p.3">For GTP encapsulated traffic from UPFs, the ingress SRV6 Locator must also deliver GTP information to the far end Locator. Please see section 5.2. for more information on different methods of conveying GTP information in SRV6 domains.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.2.3.1.p.4">The ingress SRV6 Locator then constructs the SRH and sends the traffic through the SRV6 network toward the egress RV6 Locator. Egress Locator marks the end of the segment and ships the traffic to the target UPF.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.2.3.1.p.5">It must be noted that use of GTP at UPFs allows us to leave the 3GPP control plane intact and hence provides a smooth migration path toward SRV6 with ID-Locator model. For inter UPF traffic that doesn&#8217;t use GTP, the control plane requires some modifications in order to be able to convey endpoint information to interested parties.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.6.2.3.2.p.1">In this model, the head end UPF (Ingress UPF) is the ingress node and the entity that constructs the SRH in the SRV6 domain. Here, both UPFs (IDs) and Locators are represented by SIDs in the SRH. The SID list establishes either a partial or the full path to a target or a set of UPFs that traffic is required to traverse.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.2.3.2.p.2">The 3GPP control plane is responsible for distributing UPF&#8217;s endpoint information. But it requires some modifications to be able to convey endpoint information to interested parties.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.2.3.2.p.3">In its simplest form, the SMF using policy information prepares a set of one or more UPFs along the traffic path and distributes this set in the form a SID list to the ingress UPF. This SID list of UPFs is then gets augmented with a set of SIDs identifying the Locators representing the current point of attachment for each UPF along the data path.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.2.3.2.p.4">Alternatively, the SMF can provide a fully resolved SID list by communicating with a centralised or distributed ID-LOC mapping system containing all the relevant data regarding the UPF-Locator relationship.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.2.3.2.p.5">In yet another approach, the SMF can provide a partial SID list representing the segment between each pair of UPFs to individual UPFs along the path.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.2.3.2.p.6">Regardless of the approach, any changes to UPF&#8217;s point of attachment must be reflected in the mapping system and communicated to the SMF for distribution to the appropriate set of UPFs. Keeping the mapping system current is essential to proper operation. As long as the mapping database is up-to-date, UPFs can be easily moved in the network. Design of ID-Locator mapping system is beyond the scope of this document. However, experiment with distributed mapping systems offered by today&#8217;s public clouds has shown very promising results which can be further improved and tailored to mobile network requirements.</p>

The complete specification of how to use the LISP-CP in conjunction with an ILA data-plane can be found in <a href="#I-D.rodrigueznatal-ila-lisp" class="xref">[I-D.rodrigueznatal-ila-lisp]</a>. Below are summarized the major points to take into account when running LISP-CP as control-plane for ILA.</p>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>Leveraging on the flexible LISP-CP address encoding defined in <a href="#RFC8060" class="xref">[RFC8060]</a>, different ILA address types are defined in <a href="#I-D.rodrigueznatal-ila-lisp" class="xref">[I-D.rodrigueznatal-ila-lisp]</a> to carry ILA metadata over the LISP-CP.</li>
<li>XTRs can serve as both ILA-Ns (when their map-cache is incomplete) or ILA-Rs (when their map-cache is complete). XTRs serving as ILA-Rs subscribe to the Mapping System to populate their map-cache with all the mappings in the domain (or its shard) using <a href="#I-D.ietf-lisp-pubsub" class="xref">[I-D.ietf-lisp-pubsub]</a>.</li>
<li>LISP-CP can run over TCP or UDP. The same signaling and logic applies independently of the transport. Additionally, when running over TCP, the optimizations specified in <a href="#I-D.kouvelas-lisp-map-server-reliable-transport" class="xref">[I-D.kouvelas-lisp-map-server-reliable-transport]</a> can be applied.</li>
<li>The ILA control-plane operations &#8220;request/response&#8221; and &#8220;push&#8221; are implemented via the LISP mechanisms defined in <a href="#I-D.ietf-lisp-rfc6833bis" class="xref">[I-D.ietf-lisp-rfc6833bis]</a> and <a href="#I-D.ietf-lisp-pubsub" class="xref">[I-D.ietf-lisp-pubsub]</a> respectively. When the Mapping System is co-located with the XTRs serving as ILA-Rs, the ILA &#8220;redirect&#8221; operation is implemented via the mapping notifications described in <a href="#I-D.ietf-lisp-pubsub" class="xref">[I-D.ietf-lisp-pubsub]</a>.</li>
<li>XTRs serving as ILA-Ns can use LISP-CP as described in <a href="#I-D.ietf-lisp-rfc6833bis" class="xref">[I-D.ietf-lisp-rfc6833bis]</a> to register and keep updated in the Mapping System the information regarding their local mappings.</li>
<li>When using ILA as data-plane, the mobility features and benefits discussed in Section 8 and in <a href="#I-D.ietf-lisp-eid-mobility" class="xref">[I-D.ietf-lisp-eid-mobility]</a> still apply.</li>
<li>As discussed in <a href="#I-D.rodrigueznatal-ila-lisp" class="xref">[I-D.rodrigueznatal-ila-lisp]</a>, the LISP-CP can be used not only to resolve ID-Loc mappings but also to obtain the ILA Identifier when it is not possible to locally derivate it from the endpoint address. These two mapping operations can be combined into one to obtain the ILA Identifier and associated locators in a single round of signaling.</li>

<p id="rfc.section.9.p.1">Identifier-Locator Addressing <a href="#I-D.herbert-intarea-ila" class="xref">[I-D.herbert-intarea-ila]</a> is a protocol to implement transparent network overlays without encapsulation. It addresses the need for network overlays in virtualization and mobility that are efficient, lightweight, performant, scalable, secure, provide seamless mobility, leverage and encourage use of IPv6, provide strong privacy, are interoperable with existing infrastructure, applicable to a variety of use cases, and have simplified control and management.</p>

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.10.p.1">ILA is a form of identifier/locator split where IPv6 addresses are transformed from application-visible, non-topological &#8220;identifier&#8221; addresses to topological &#8220;locator&#8221; addresses. Locator addresses allow packets to be forwarded to the network location where a logical or mobile node currently resides or is attached. Before delivery to the ultimate destination, locator addresses are reverse transformed back to the original application visible addresses. ILA does address &#8220;transformation&#8221; as opposed to &#8220;translation&#8221; since address modifications are always undone. ILA is conceptually similar to ILNP and 8+8, however ILA is contained in the network layer. It is not limited to end node deployment, does not require any changes to transport layer protocols, and does not use extension headers.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.10.p.2">ILA includes both a data plane and control plane. The data plane defines the address structure and mechanisms for transforming application visible identifier addresses to locator addresses. The control plane&#8217;s primary focus is a mapping system that includes a database of identifier to locator mappings. This mapping database drives ILA transformations. Control plane protocols disseminate identifier to locator mappings amongst ILA nodes.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.10.p.3">The use cases of ILA include mobile networks, datacenter virtualization, and network virtualization. A recent trend in the industry is to build converged networks containing all three of these to provide low latency and high availability. A single network overlay solution that works across multiple use cases is appealing.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.10.p.4">Benefits of ILA include:</p>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>Facilitates node mobility and virtualization</li>
<li>Multiple use cases (mobile, datacenter, cloud)</li>
<li>Super efficient and performant data plane</li>
<li>Allows strong privacy in addressing [ADDRPRIV]</li>
<li>Promotes anchorless mobility</li>
<li>No typical tunneling issues (e.g. MTU) or management related to encapsulation</li>
<li>Flexible control plane that splits data and control</li>
<li>Modern &#8220;SDN&#8221; control protocols (e.g. RPC/TCP)</li>
<li>Scale number of nodes to billions for 5G, DC virtualization</li>

<p id="rfc.section.11.p.3">In this architecture, ILA replaces GTP use over the N9 interface. Identifier address to locator address transformations in the downlink from the data network are done by an ILA-R.

Locator address to identifier address transformation happen at ILA-Ns.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.p.4">ILA could be supported on a gNB. In this case, an ILA-N would be co- resident at a gNB and ILA is used over N3 interface in lieu GTP-U.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.11.2.2.p.2">The ILA mapping system is effectively a key/value datastore that maps identifiers to locators.

ILAMP defines redirects, a request/response protocol, and a push mechanism to populate the mapping table. Unlike traditional routing protocols that run over UDP, this protocol is intended to be run over TCP and may be RPC oriented. TCP provides reliability, statefulness implied by established connections, ordering, and security in the form of TLS. Secure redirects are facilitated by the use of TCP.

<p id="rfc.section.11.3.2.p.7">The locator index is not globally unique, it is specific to each ILA-N. When a node attaches to an ILA-N, an index is chosen so that the table is populated at the ILA-N and the ILA mapping includes the locator and index. When a node detaches from on ILA, it&#8217;s entry in the table is removed and the index can be reused after a hold-down period to allow stale mappings to be purged.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.11.6.p.3">Slice #2 supports ILA. Some number of ILA-Ns and ILA-Rs are deployed. ILA transformations are performed over the N9 interface. ILA-Rs would be deployed at the N6 interface to perform transformations on packets received from a data network. ILA-Ns will be deployed deeper in the network at one side of the N3 interface. ILA-Ns may be supplemented by ILA-Rs that are deployed in the network. ILA-M manages the ILA nodes and mapping database within the slice.</p>

The slice contains ILA-Rs and ILA-Ns, and as illustrated, it may also contain ILA_Hs that run directly on edge computing servers. Note in this example, one ILA-M, and hence one ILA domain, is shared between slice #2 and slice #3. Alternatively, the two slices could each have their own ILA-M and define separate ILA domains.</p>

In 5GS, SMF manages sessions, and thus SMF may be required to update mapping database when an UE moves to under another UPF or an NF is moved to another dDN.

<p><strong>Locator-based architectures</strong></p>
<p id="rfc.section.13.1.p.2">IP communication relies solely on locators (host interfaces&#8217; addresses) that are also used as node/service identifiers at network layer. Such semantic overloading of IP addresses as both identifiers and locators does not allow to disentangle locators from location-independent traffic identifiers, thus complexifying mobility management.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.13.1.p.3">As a result, traffic anchors and tunnels have been introduced to handle mobility while preserving the identifier exposed to the transport layer.</p>
<p><strong>Locator-ID separation architectures</strong></p>
<p id="rfc.section.13.1.p.5">To overcome the limitations of purely locator-based architectures, there have been proposed the so called &#8220;identifier/locator separation&#8221; (or Loc/ID split) schemes, using separate namespaces for identifiers and locators, and a mapping system allowing routers to bind them together.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.13.1.p.6">Loc/ID split has been originally proposed by LISP, and is central to ILSR and ILNP proposals. The other approaches reviewed in this document, namely ILA, or the SRv6 proposal, also falls in the same category and share the requirements of a mapping system. This service can be centralized/decentralized or distributed where a correspondence of ID and locators is stored and updated upon changes.</p>
<p><strong>ID-based architectures</strong></p>
<p id="rfc.section.13.1.p.8">A third class of approaches exists that redefines IP communication principles (i.e. network and transport layers) around location-independent identifiers <a href="#I-D.vonhugo-5gangip-ip-issues" class="xref">[I-D.vonhugo-5gangip-ip-issues]</a>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.13.1.p.9">The work done around Information-Centric Networking (ICN) falls into such class of approaches that we refer to as purely ID-based, also known as name-based <a href="#I-D.irtf-icnrg-terminology" class="xref">[I-D.irtf-icnrg-terminology]</a>, and whose properties especially for mobility management we focus on in the rest of the section.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.13.2.p.1">The appeal of purely ID-based architectures is that they move Loc/ID split one step further by embedding ID-awareness in the network and transport layer by default and as such completely decoupling data delivery from underlying network connectivity. Forwarding is performed directly based on identifiers stored in routers&#8217; FIBs and no mapping of ID into locators is required. In this way, purely ID-based architectures remove the need to maintain a global mapping system at scale, and its intrinsic management complexity.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.13.2.p.2">Additional benefits brought specifically by ICN principles motivate the consideration of ICN solutions for next generation mobility architectures, e.g.</p>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>the flexibility of multi-source/multi-path connectionless pull-based transport. An example is the native support for consumer mobility, i.e. the transparent emission of data requests over multiple and varying available network interfaces during node mobility;</li>

<p id="rfc.section.13.3.p.1">Hybrid ICN (hICN) is an ICN architecture that defines integration of ICN semantics within IPv6, instead of over/under/aside. The only difference w.r.t. ICN as defined in <a href="#I-D.irtf-icnrg-ccnxsemantics" class="xref">[I-D.irtf-icnrg-ccnxsemantics]</a> is that it encodes names inside IP addresses, and thus can use RFC-compliant TCP/IP packets to transport ICN semantics.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.13.3.p.2">The goal of hICN is to ease ICN insertion in existing IP infrastructure by:</p>
<p></p>

<p id="rfc.section.13.4.p.1">In ICN and hICN endpoints can act as consumers and/or producers. Consumers when they emit requests for named data packets (so called Interests), producers when they send data packets in response to consumers request (pull-based transport model).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.13.4.p.2">Clearly a node can be a consumer and a producer at the same time (e.g. in a voice conversation).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.13.4.p.3">Consumer and producer mobility are handled in a different way due to the pull-based request model. More specifically, consumer mobility is natively supported: consumers pull traffic by sending Interest packets towards named content (wherever produced/stored, the source is a priori unknown by the consumer). Interests are named-based forwarded using the information found in traversed routers&#8217; FIBs.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.13.4.p.4">In case of consumer mobility, i.e. mobility of the endpoint issuing the requests, selection of a new available output interface and retransmission of not-yet-satisfied Interests is sufficient for data delivery to continue, independently from the underlying change of locators. Consumer mobility is fully anchorless with hICN, and does not incur any signalization nor tunneling overhead.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.13.4.p.5">Producer mobility is not natively supported by ICN architecture, rather handled in different ways according to the selected producer mobility management scheme.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.13.4.p.6">In <a href="#I-D.irtf-icnrg-mapme" class="xref">[I-D.irtf-icnrg-mapme]</a> and <a href="#MAPME" class="xref">[MAPME]</a> producer mobility schemes are classified into four classes:</p>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>
<em>Resolution based</em> solutions rely on dedicated rendez-vous nodes (similar to DNS) which map content names into routable location identifiers. To maintain this mapping updated, the producer signals every movement to the mapping system.  Once the resolution is performed, packets can be correctly routed directly to the producer.</li>
<li>
<em>Anchor-based</em> proposals are inspired by Mobile IP, and maintain a mapping at network-layer by using a stable home address advertised by a rendez-vous node, or anchor. This acts as a relay, forwarding through tunneling both interests to the producer, and data packets coming back.</li>
<li>
<em>Tracing-based</em> solutions allow the mobile node to create a hop-by-hop forwarding reverse path from its RV back to itself by propagating and keeping alive traces stored by all involved routers. Forwarding to the new location is enabled without tunneling.</li>
<li>
<em>Anchorless</em> approaches allow the mobile nodes to advertise their mobility to the network without requiring any specific node to act as a rendez-vous point.</li>
</ul>
<p id="rfc.section.13.4.p.8">The selected mobility management scheme for hICN is MAP-Me, an anchorless producer mobility management solution originally proposed for ICN <a href="#I-D.irtf-icnrg-mapme" class="xref">[I-D.irtf-icnrg-mapme]</a> <a href="#MAPME" class="xref">[MAPME]</a> and further extended to hICN in <a href="#I-D.auge-hicn-mobility" class="xref">[I-D.auge-hicn-mobility]</a>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.13.4.p.9">MAP-Me belongs to the class of anchorless approaches that relies on scope-limited forwarding updates triggered by producer mobility events to keep locally up-to-date FIB information for a low-latency guaranteed reroute of consumer Interests towards changing location of the producer.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.13.4.p.10">The difference w.r.t. to other classes of approaches is that it does not require an anchor neither in forwarding plane (traffic does not need to pass through a specific network node), nor in the control plane (no rendez-vous point, no mapping system).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.13.4.p.11">As detailed in <a href="#I-D.auge-hicn-mobility" class="xref">[I-D.auge-hicn-mobility]</a> using MAP-Me, hICN provides anchorless consumer and producer mobility removing the need for tunnels and for ID mapping.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.13.4.p.12">Signaling of mobility is only required upon producer movements and limited in scope to current-to-previous network hops. Unlike routing updates, it is not necessary to update all routers&#8217; FIBs after a node has moved, but only those located on the path between the new and a former position of the producer.  MAP-Me realizes this process in a distributed fashion through in-band signaling packets, hence its anchorless property with respect to the control plane too.  Scalability of producer mobility is guaranteed by an efficient and secure FIB update process with minimal and bounded path stretch.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.13.4.p.13">Forwarding and mobility management operations in hICN are based only location-independent identifiers, preserving coexistence with IP locators whose existence may be required by non-hICN services and by control/management plane operations specific to the considered network architecture. As an example, in the case of 3GPP architectures, MAP-Me mobility management does not require an additional control plane anchor.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.13.5.1.p.1">By operating directly on routers&#8217; FIBs for mobility updates, dynamic hop-by-hop forwarding strategies etc., hICN inherits the simplicity of IP forwarding and reuses IP routing protocols for ID prefixes advertisement and routing.  In this way it removes the challenges of managing a distributed mapping service at scale (cache update/refresh, etc.).  In addition it remains compatible with the exiting control plane architecture as proposed in the 3GPP standard, with no change required to N1, N2 or N4.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.13.5.1.p.2">MAP-Me anchorless producer mobility management does not imply SMF interaction, but does not exclude neither to use SMF signaling to trigger MAP-Me updates or to handle FIB updates, at the condition to follow the same procedure described for MAP-Me. However, the absence of SMF interaction might be beneficial in case of dense deployments or failure of the central control entities (infrastructure-less communication scenarios) to empower distributed control of local mobility within an area.</p>

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.13.5.4.p.1">hICN is designed to operate inside an IPv6 network by means of an enriched communication layer supporting ICN primitives. The targeted deployment of a few hICN-empowered nodes leads to the tradeoff between incremental deployment and benefits which are proportionally related to the degree of hICN penetration. The association of hICN with other data planes technologies is investigated as a possibility to overcome the above-mentioned tradeoff yielding to a selective, yet fully beneficial insertion of hICN in IP networks.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.13.5.4.p.2">To this aim, we focus on hICN insertion in a Segment Routing (SR) enhanced data plane, specifically considering SRv6 instantiation of SR. More details are provided in <a href="#I-D.auge-hicn-mobility-deployment-options" class="xref">[I-D.auge-hicn-mobility-deployment-options]</a>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.13.5.4.p.3">hICN/SRv6 combination inherits all SRv6 advantages presented in SR-dedicated section of this document, namely &#8220;underlay&#8221; management (fast reroute, etc.), service chaining or fine-grained TE for instance.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.13.5.4.p.4">In addition, it allows extending the reach of hICN on regular IP routers with SRv6 functionality. One realization being to create SRv6 domains in between hICN nodes. The hICN router (through forwarding strategies) would then act as a control plane for SRv6 by specifying the list of SIDs to insert in the packet.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.13.5.4.p.5">SRv6 forwarding of packets between hICN hops would allow to enforce dynamic per-application hICN forwarding strategies and their objectives (path steering, QoS, etc.), which would be otherwise not possible over not hICN-enabled IP network segments. It would also allow dynamic multi-path and load balancing in hICN-unaware IP network segments and it could guarantee request/reply IP path symmetry (instrumental for efficient round trip delay measurements and rate/congestion control).</p>

<p id="rfc.section.13.6.1.p.1">We review benefits resulting from the deployment of hICN nodes, not specific to the replacement of N9.</p>
<p></p>

<ul><li>Low-latency and multicast capabilities by means of in-path edge caching</li></ul>
<p id="rfc.section.13.6.1.p.3">The ability to satisfy UE requests close to the access is important for latency-sensitive applications such as AR/VR and for cost-efficient transport (that minimizes high-throughput traffic carrying to the core when it can be satisfied locally).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.13.6.1.p.4">In addition, hICN ability to serve requests from cache or to aggregate them implicitly realizes opportunistic multicast distribution of popular content improving users&#8217; QoE for service such as VoD or live streaming, while greatly offloading the mobile core.</p>
<p></p>

<ul><li>Consumer mobility improvements</li></ul>
<p id="rfc.section.13.6.1.p.6">The combined use of identifiers and a pull-model allows for seamless mobility across heterogeneous wired and wireless networks, as well as their simultaneous use for multi-homing and bandwidth aggregation. A specific feature of hICN is to allow the use of multiple path/sources of content at the same time, for instance edge caches located at the edge of different fixed/mobile network accesses.</p>
<p></p>

<ul><li>Network-assisted transport</li></ul>
<p id="rfc.section.13.6.1.p.8">On-path insertion of hICN enables the use of network buffers to optimize traffic engineering including multipath and load balancing support. One interesting deployment consists in enabling hICN in the PDU Session Anchor, so as to allow two downstream paths back to the mobile edge (due to hICN replacing the datagram source address by the locator of the output UPF), thereby exploiting additional upstream path diversity / resiliency. The ability to perform in-network assistance (for rate/loss/congestion control) is an additional advantage, e.g.  to support rate adaptation in the case of dynamic adaptive streaming, or to improve reliability of WiFi connection through transparent wireless detection and recovery <a href="#WLDR" class="xref">[WLDR]</a>.</p>

<p></p>

<ul><li>Anchorless consumer and producer mobility</li></ul>
<p id="rfc.section.13.6.2.p.2">Removing N9 tunnels is key to allow a fully anchorless solution, by not forcing all traffic to transit through the anchoring point in the core. Local forwarding decisions will allow the offloading of device-to-device communications when the different UEs are topologically close, as well as network operations when some areas are disconnected from the core (disaster recovery for instance).</p>
<p></p>

<ul><li>Dynamic forwarding strategies / UPF selection</li></ul>
<p id="rfc.section.13.6.2.p.4">Dynamic selection of next hop or exit point is simplified as it can be performed locally based on identifiers and/or locally available information (e.g.  interface measurements) in virtue of service-specific forwarding strategies.</p>

</h1>
<p></p>

<ul><li>Removal of tunnel management state and signaling</li></ul>
<p id="rfc.section.13.6.3.p.2">The clear advantage is the complete removal of tunnels. Forwarding beyond the radio access is directly managed through hICN. As a consequence, no additional state nor signaling is required for static and mobile consumers, nor for static producers. The impact of producer mobility is low because of the small number of impacted routers.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.13.6.3.p.3">Deploying hICN on both N3 and N9 further presents the advantage of removing the need for inter-networking with remaining GTP tunnels between those two interfaces. The result is a simpler and lighter architecture, allowing convergence with other non-3GPP accesses.</p>
<p></p>

<ul><li>Dynamic first UPF selection</li></ul>
<p id="rfc.section.13.6.3.p.5">Dynamic forwarding capabilities are extended in this configuration to the selection of the first UPF, with the potential of additional performance improvement and higher traffic offload because of the deployment of hICN functionalities closer to the UE. A significant advantage arises in dense deployments scenarios where it becomes possible to isolate the core network from the locally-management mobility (a design objective of the mobile architecture), while allowing distributed selection of ingress UPFs, and dynamic per-packet load balancing of traffic across them.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.13.6.4.1.p.2">As an example of use of hICN in a slice, a service provider might for instance decide to use an hICN-enabled slice dedicated to video delivery, with appropriate mobility management, and dedicated hICN nodes with appropriate caching/forwarding strategies at places aggregating considerable number of user requests.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.13.6.4.2.p.1">The deployment of an hICN stack in endpoints is the preferred option and offers the full range of benefits. The hICN network stack and forwarder are available through two reference implementations based on the CICN project <a href="#CICN" class="xref">[CICN]</a>. They share an objective of smooth deployment in existing devices, and are fully userland based. The first is built on top of existing IP primitives and proposed as an application/library for all major OS vendors including iOS, Android, Linux and Windows. The second targets high-performance routers and servers, and leverages the VPP kernel-bypass technology.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.13.6.4.3.p.1">It is not always possible nor desirable to affect endpoints, and a deployment fully contained in the network, or within the N9 interface is possible through the deployment of proxies. An overview of different options implemented at the network, transport or application level are considered. An example would be the deployment of HTTP proxies at the ingress and egress (resp.  first and last UPFs), in order to benefit from content awareness in the network.  Such configuration however reduces the flexibility and dynamic forwarding capabilities in endpoints. In particular, existing transport protocols have limited support for dynamically changing paths or network conditions.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.13.6.4.3.p.2">Traffic that is not handled though hICN mechanisms can still benefit from the lower overhead and anchorless mobility capabilities coming from the removal of GTP tunnels, as well as dynamic forwarding capabilities that are inherent to the forwarding pipeline. This results from the ability to assign location-independent identifiers to endpoints. It preserves the advantage of removing the mapping system, and of a lightweight FIB update process. No encapsulation is required and packet headers are not modified, which allows the network to have visibility in the source and/or destination identifiers.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.13.7.p.1">hICN proposes a general purpose architecture that combines the benefits of a pure-ID architecture with those of ICN. While a full deployment is recommended to make efficient use of available network resources, it is still possible to opt for a partial or phased deployment, with the associated tradeoffs that we have reviewed here.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.13.7.p.2">An hICN enabled network offers native offloading capabilities thanks to the anchorless properties resulting from the pure-ID communication scheme. It does so without the need for a third party mapping system, and further requires no change in the 5G architecture nor in its control plane. The architecture will further leverage the incremental insertion of information centric functionalities through proxies or direct insertion in user devices as the technology gets adopted and deployed.</p>
