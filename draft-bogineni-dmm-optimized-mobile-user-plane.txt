              Optimized Mobile User Plane Solutions for 5G
           draft-bogineni-dmm-optimized-mobile-user-plane-01

Abstract

   3GPP CT4 has approved a study item to study different mobility
   management protocols for potential replacement of GTP tunnels between
   UPFs (N9 Interface) in the 3GPP 5G system architecture.

   This document provides an overview of 5G system architecture in the
   context of N9 Interface which is the scope of the 3GPP CT4 study item
   [TS.23.501-3GPP], [TS.23.502-3GPP], [TS.23.503-3GPP],
   [TS.23.203-3GPP], [TS.29.244-3GPP], [TS.29.281-3GPP],
   [TS.38.300-3GPP], and [TS.38.401-3GPP].  The requirements for the
   network functions and the relevant interfaces are provided.

   Reference scenarios and criteria for evaluation of various IETF
   protocols are provided.

   Several IETF protocols are considered for comparison: SRv6, LISP, ILA
   and several combinations of control plane and user plane protocols.

1.  Introduction and Problem Statement

   3GPP CT4 WG has approved a study item [CT4SID] to study user-plane
   protocol for N9 in 5GC architecture as specified in [TS.23.501-3GPP]
   and [TS.23.502-3GPP] for Rel-15.  This provides an opportunity to
   investigate potential limits of the existing user plane solution and
   potential benefits of alternative user plane solutions.

   # Include scope of CT4 study item (user plane)

   # Add SA2 study item and relevant scope of the work (control plane)

   # Scope of control plane and user plane considerations

   IETF has some protocols for potential consideration as candidates.
   These protocols have the potential to simplify the architecture
   through reduction/elimination of encapsulation; use of native routing
   mechanisms; support of anchor-less mobility management; reduction of
   session state and reduction of signaling associated with mobility
   management.

   This document comprehensively describes the various protocols and how
   they can be used in the 3GPP 5G architecture.  Specifically Segment
   Routing v6 (SRv6), Locator Identifier Separation Protocol (LISP) and
   Identifier Locator Addressing (ILA) are described in the context of
   the 3GPP 5G architecture for several scenarios: as a replacement of
   GTP on N9; as a replacement of GTP in the whole system; integrated
   with transport; used in specific network slices, etc.

   A comparison of the various protocols is also provided.

3.  Overview of Existing Architecture and Protocol Stack

   This section briefly describes the 5G system architecture as
   specified in 3GPP TS 23.501.  The key relevant features for session
   management and mobility management are:

   o  Separate the User Plane (UP) functions from the Control Plane (CP)
      functions, allowing independent scalability, evolution and
      flexible deployments e.g.  centralized location or distributed
      (remote) location.

   o  Support concurrent access to local and centralized services.  To
      support low latency services and access to local data networks, UP
      functions can be deployed close to the Access Network.

   o  Support roaming with both Home routed traffic as well as Local
      breakout traffic in the visited PLMN.

   Figure 5 depicts the non-roaming architecture for UEs concurrently
   accessing two (e.g. local and central) data networks using multiple
   PDU Sessions, using the reference point representation.  This figure
   shows the architecture for multiple PDU Sessions where two SMFs are
   selected for the two different PDU Sessions.  However, each SMF may
   also have the capability to control both a local and a central UPF
   within a PDU Session.

    Figure 6: Non-roaming 5G System Architecture for Current Access to
   Two (e.g. local and central) Data Networks (single PDU Session option

   Figure 6 depicts the non-roaming architecture in case concurrent
   access to two (e.g. local and central) data networks is provided
   within a single PDU Session.

   The User plane function (UPF) is the function relevant to this
   evaluation and the N9 interface between two UPFs [23501].

   The User Plane Function (UPF) handles the user plane path of PDU
   sessions.  The UPF transmits the PDUs of the PDU session in a single
   tunnel between 5GC and (R)AN.  The UPF includes the following
   functionality.  Some or all of the UPF functionalities may be
   supported in a single instance of a UPF.  Not all of the UPF
   functionalities are required to be supported in an instance of user
   plane function of a Network Slice.

   o  Anchor point for Intra-/Inter-RAT mobility (when applicable)"

   o  Sending and forwarding of one or more end marker to the source NG-
      RAN node

   o  External PDU Session point of interconnect to Data Network.

   o  PDU session type: IPv4, IPv6, Ethernet, Unstructured (type of PDU
      totally transparent to the 5GS)

   o  Activation and release of the UP connection of an PDU session,
      upon UE transition between the CM-IDLE and CM-CONNECTED

      states(i.e. activation and release of N3 tunnelling towards the
      access network)

   o  Data forwarding between the SMF and the UE or DN (e.g.  IP address
      allocation or DN authorization during the establishment of a PDU
      session)

   o  Packet routing and forwarding (e.g. support of Uplink classifier
      to route traffic flows to an instance of a data network, support
      of Branching point to support IPv6 multi-homed PDU session>

   o  Branching Point to support routing of traffic flows of an IPv6
      multi-homed PDU session to a data network, based on the source
      Prefix of the PDU

   o  User Plane part of policy rule enforcement (e.g.  Gating,
      Redirection, Traffic steering)

   o  Uplink Classifier enforcement to support routing traffic flows to
      a data network, e.g. based on the destination IP address/Prefix of
      the UL PDU

   o  Lawful intercept (UP collection)

   o  Traffic usage reporting (e.g. allowing SMF support for charging,
      and/or allowing the SMF to initiate a CN initiated deactivation of
      UP connection of an existing PDU session when the UPF detects that
      the PDU Session has no user plane data activity for a specified
      Inactivity period provided by the SMF)

   o  QoS handling for user plane including:

      *  packet filtering, gating, UL/DL rate enforcement, UL/DL
         Session-AMBR enforcement (with the Session-AMBR computed by the
         UPF over the Averaging window provisioned over N4, see
         subclause 5.7.3 of 3GPP TS 23.501), UL/DL Guaranteed Flow Bit
         Rate (GFBR) enforcement, UL/DL Maximum Flow Bit Rate (MFBR)
         enforcement, etc

      *  marking packets with the QoS Flow ID (QFI) in an encapsulation
         header on N3 (the QoS flow is the finest granularity of QoS
         differentiation in the PDU session)

      *  enabling/disabling reflective QoS activation via the User
         Plane, i.e.  marking DL packets with the Reflective QoS
         Indication (RQI) in the encapsulation header on N3, for DL
         packets matching a QoS Rule that contains an indication to
         activate reflective QoS

   o  Uplink Traffic verification (SDF to QoS flow mapping, i.e.
      checking that QFIs in the UL PDUs are aligned with the QoS Rules
      provided to the UE or implicitly derived by the UE e.g. when using
      reflective QoS)

   o  Transport level packet marking in the uplink and downlink, e.g.
      based on 5QI and ARP of the associated QoS flow

   o  Packet Filter Set is used in the QoS rules or SDF template to
      identify a QoS flow.  The Packet Filter Set may contain packet
      filters for the DL direction, the UL direction or packet filters
      that are applicable to both directions.

   o  Downlink packet buffering and downlink data notification
      triggering: This includes the support and handling of the ARP
      priority of QoS Flows over the N4 interface, to support priority
      mechanism:



- "For a UE that is not configured for priority treatment, upon receiving
the "N7 PDU-CAN Session Modification" message from the PCF with an ARP
priority level that is entitled for priority use, the SMF sends an "N4
Session Modification Request" to update the ARP for the Signalling QoS
Flows, and sends an "N11 SM Request with PDU Session Modification Command"
message to the AMF, as specified in clause 4.3.3.2 of TS 23.502.
- "If an IP packet arrives at the UPF for a UE that is CM-IDLE over a QoS
Flow which has an ARP priority level value that is entitled for priority
use, delivery of priority indication during the Paging procedure is
provided by inclusion of the ARP in the N4 interface "Downlink Data
Notification" message, as specified in clause 4.2.3.4 of TS 23.502."

   o  ARP proxying as specified in [RFC1027] and / or IPv6 Neighbour
      Solicitation Proxying as specified in [RFC4861] functionality for
      the Ethernet PDUs.  The UPF responds to the ARP and / or the IPv6
      Neighbour Solicitation Request by providing the MAC address
      corresponding to the IP address sent in the request.

   o  Packet inspection (e.g.  Application detection based on service
      data flow template and the optional PFDs received from the SMF in
      addition)

   o  Traffic detection capabilities.

      *  For IP PDU session type, the UPF traffic detection capabilities
         may detect traffic using traffic pattern based on at least any
         combination of:

- QFI (QoS Flow Identifier), see subclause 5.7.1 of 3GPP TS 23.501:

    "A QoS Flow ID (QFI) is used to identify a QoS flow in the 5G system. User Plane traffic with the same QFI within a PDU session receives the same traffic forwarding treatment (e.g. scheduling, admission threshold). The QFI is carried in an encapsulation header on N3 (and N9) i.e. without any changes to the e2e packet header. It can be applied to PDUs with different types of payload, i.e. IP packets, non-IP PDUs and Ethernet frames. The QFI shall be unique within a PDU session." The QFI is sent for both downlink and uplink user plane traffic.


- RQI (Reflective QoS Identifier), see subclause 5.7.5.4.2 of 3GPP TS
23.501:

    "When the 5GC determines to activate reflective QoS via U-plane, the SMF
    shall include a QoS rule including an indication to the UPF via N4
    interface to activate User Plane with user plane reflective. When the
    UPF receives a DL packet matching the QoS rule that contains an
    indication to activate reflective QoS, the UPF shall include the RQI in
    the encapsulation header on N3 reference point. The UE creates a UE
    derived QoS rule when the UE receives a DL packet with a RQI." The RQI
    is sent for downlink user plane traffic only.

- Support of RAN initiated QoS Flow mobility, when using Dual connectivity,
also requires the QFI to be sent within End Marker packets. See subclause
5.11.1 of 3GPP TS 23.501 and subclause 4.14.1 of 3GPP TS 23.502
respectively:

    - " For some other PDU sessions of an UE: Direct the DL User Plane
    traffic of some QoS flows of the PDU session to the Secondary
    (respectively Master) RAN Node while the remaining QoS flows of the PDU
    session are directed to the Master (respectively Secondary) RAN Node. In
    this case there are, irrespective of the number of QoS Flows, two N3
    tunnel terminations at the RAN for such PDU session."

    - " In order to assist the reordering function in the Master RAN node
    and/or Secondary RAN node, for the QFIs that are switched between Master
    RAN node and Secondary RAN node, the UPF sends one or more "end marker"
    packets along with QFI on the old tunnel immediately after switching the
    tunnel for the QFI. The UPF starts sending downlink packets to the
    Target RAN."

   GTPv1-U as defined in 3GPP TS 29.281 is used over the N3 and N9
   interfaces in Release 15.  Release 15 is still work-in-progress and
   RAN3 will specify the contents of the 5GS Container.  It is to be
   decided whether CT4 needs to specify new GTP-U extension header(s) in
   3GPP TS 29.281 for the 5GS Container.

   A GTP-U tunnel is used per PDU session to encapsulate T-PDUs and
   GTP-U signaling messages (e.g.  End Marker, Echo Request, Error
   Indication) between GTP-U peers.

   A 5GS Container is defined as a new single GTP-U Extension Header
   over the N3 and N9 interfaces and the elements are added to this

   container as they appear with the forthcoming features and releases.
   This approach would allow to design the 5GS information elements
   independently from the tunneling protocol used within the 5GS, i.e.
   it would achieve the separation of the Transport Network Layer (TNL)
   and Radio Network Layer (RNL) as required in 3GPP TR 38.801 subclause
   7.3.2.  This would allow to not impact the RNL if in a future release
   a new transport network layer (TNL) other than GTP-U/UDP/IP (e.g.
   GRE/IP) was decided to be supported.

   The protocol stack for the User Plane transport for a PDU session is
   depicted below in Figure 7.

   o GPRS Tunnelling Protocol for the user plane (GTP U): This protocol
       supports multiplexing traffic of different PDU sessions (possibly
       corresponding to different PDU session Types) by tunnelling user
       data over N3 (i.e. between the AN node and the UPF) in the
       backbone network. GTP shall encapsulate all end user PDUs. It
       provides encapsulation on a per PDU session level. This layer
       carries also the marking associated with a QoS Flow.
   o 5G Encapsulation: This layer supports multiplexing traffic of
       different PDU sessions (possibly corresponding to different PDU
       session Types) over N9 (i.e. between different UPF of the 5GC).
       It provides encapsulation on a per PDU session level. This layer

5.  SRv6 Based Solution

5.1.  Overview

   Segment Routing (SR), defined in [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing]
   generalises the source routing paradigm with an ordered list of
   global and/or nodal instructions (segments) prepended in an SR header
   in order to either steer traffic flows through the network while
   confining flow states to the ingress nodes in the SR domains and/or
   to indicate functions that are performed at specific network
   locations.

   The IPV6 realisation of SR (SRV6) defines a SR Header (SRH), see
   [I-D.ietf-6man-segment-routing-header].  SRV6 encodes segments as
   IPV6 addresses in the Segment List (SL) of its header.  The packet
   destination address in SRV6 specifies the active segment while an
   index field in the SRH points to the next active segment in the list.
   The index field in SRH is decremented as SRV6 progressively forces
   packet flows through different segments over the IPV6 data plane.

   The versatility and adaptability of SR combined with IPV6's ample and
   flexible address space positions SRV6 as a viable data path
   technology for the next generation of mobile user plane, in
   particular the 3GPP N9 (UPF to UPF).

   This section starts by summarising the use of SRV6 as a drop-in
   alternative for GTP-U over the N9 interface connecting different User
   Plane Functions (UPF).  It then shows how SRV6 as a GTP-U replacement
   can then provide additional features such as TE, sparing, rate
   limiting, and service chaining that are not natively available by
   GTP.

   The discussion then focuses on advanced routing with the Identifier/
   Locator paradigm and shows how SRV6 can be used to realise this model
   in the mobile back-haul in either an anchored or anchorless mode of
   operation.

   SRV6 appears well placed as a mechanism to replace GTP-U with
   initially no control plane changes, but to then offer a progressive
   path towards many innovations in routing.

5.2.  SRV6 as Drop-In Alternative for GTP-U

   Existing mobile back-haul employs GTP tunnels to carry user traffic
   flows in the network.  These tunnels are unidirectional, are
   established via the control plane for a particular QoS level, and run
   on links between access and the different anchor nodes all the way to
   DN gateways. 3GPP uses the term UPF to refer to the variety of
   functions performing different tasks on user traffic along the data
   path in 5G networks and suggests the use of GTP tunnels to carry user
   traffic between these UPFs (N9 interface).

   The Tunnel Id (TEID) field in the GTP tunnel plays a crucial role in
   stitching the data path between the above mentioned network nodes for
   a particular user flow.  In other words, TEIDs are used to coordinate
   traffic hand off between different UPFs.

   In its most basic form, SRV6 can be used as a simple drop-in
   alternative for GTP tunnels.  The control plane in this approach
   remains the same, and still attempts to establish GTP-U tunnels and
   communicate TEIDs between the tunnel end points.  However, at the
   user plane, SRV6 capable nodes use SIDs to direct user traffic
   between the UPFs.

   The simplest option is to encapsulate the entire GTP frame as a
   payload within SRV6.  However, this scheme still carries the GTP
   header as the payload and as such doesn't offer significant
   advantage.

   A much more promising option however is to use SIDs to carry tunnel
   related information.  Here, TEIDs and other relevant data can be
   encoded into SRV6 SIDs which can be mapped back to TEID's at the
   intermediate UPFs thus requiring no changes except at the
   encapsulation and de-encapsulation points in the UPF chains.

   [I-D.ietf-dmm-srv6-mobile-uplane] discusses the details of leveraging
   the existing control plane for distributing GTP tunnel information
   between the end nodes and employing SRV6 in data plane for UPF
   connectivity.  The document defines a SID structure for conveying
   TEID, DA, and SA of GTP tunnels, shows how hybrid IPV4/IPV6 networks
   are supported by this model and in doing so, it paves a migration
   path toward a full SRV6 data plane.

   Another alternative that can provide for a smooth migration toward
   SRV6 data plane between UPFs is via the use of "Tag", and optional
   TLV fields in SRH.  Similar to the previously described method, this
   approach takes advantage of the existing control plane to deliver GTP
   tunnel information to the UPF endpoints.  "Tag" and optional TLV
   fields in SRH are then used to encode tunnel information in the SRV6

Internet-Drafdraft-bogineni-dmm-optimized-mobile-user-plane    June 2018


   data plane where the UPFs can determine the TEID etc. by inverting
   the mapping.

   In yet another option, GTP tunnel information can be encoded as a
   separate SID either within the same SRH after the SID that identifies
   the UPF itself (SRH-UPF)or inside a separate SRH (SRH-G).  In this
   option, SID representing the GTP tunnel information acts as both
   start and end point of a segment within the UPF.  This option
   resembles the MPLS label stacking mechanism which is widely used in
   different VPN scenarios.

   It must be noted that in any of the above mentioned approaches, the
   ingress UPF in SRV6 domain can insert a SRH containing the list of
   SIDs that corresponds to all UPFs along the path.  Alternatively,
   UPFs can stack a new SRH on top of the one inserted by the previous
   one as packets traverse network paths between different pairs of UPFs
   in the network.

5.3.  SRV6 as Drop-In GTP Replacement with TE

   The previous section discussed using SRV6 as a drop-in replacement
   for GTP tunnels in existing mobile networks.  No new capabilities
   were introduced by this simple 1 to 1 replacement.  We now explore
   additional possible features once SRV6 has been introduced.

   Traffic engineering is an integral feature of SR.  The SRV6 variant
   of SR of course supports both strict and loose models of source
   routing.  Here, the SID list in SRH can represent a loose or strict
   path to UPFs.  Therefore, traffic engineering can easily be supported
   regardless of any of the aforementioned approaches.

   For loose paths to UPFs, a set of one or more SIDs in SRH's SID list
   identifies on or more, but not all the intermediate nodes to a
   particular UPF.  Packets then follow the IGP shortest path through



Bogigeni, et al.        Expires December 9, 2018               [Page 19]

Internet-Drafdraft-bogineni-dmm-optimized-mobile-user-plane    June 2018


   the network to each specified intermediate node till they reach the
   target UPF.

   In the case of strict path to UPFs, SRH contains a set of SIDs
   representing all the intermediate nodes and links that the packet
   must visit on its route to a particular UPF.  The last SID in the set
   represents the target UPF itself or the last link to this UPF.  Here,
   SRV6 packet processing at each node invokes the function(s) that is
   associated with SID[SL], the packet then receives the required
   treatment and gets forwarded over the SRH's specified path toward the
   target UPF.

   It must be noted that the SRH could contain multiple sets of SIDs
   each representing a TE path between a pair of UPFs.  Alternatively,
   the SRH can contain a fully resolved end to end TE path that covers
   every intermediate node and UPF along the data plane.

   SR considers segments to be instructions.  Therefore each SID can
   represent a function that enforces a specific nodal or global packet
   treatment.  Attributes such as jitter and delay requirement, rate
   limiting factors, etc. can be easily encoded in to SIDs in order to
   apply the desired treatment as packets traverse the network from UPF
   to UPF.  [I-D.ietf-dmm-srv6-mobile-uplane] suggests a SID encoding
   mechanism for rate limiting purposes.

   Please refer to the followings for further details about SR and SRV6
   traffic engineering capabilities, network programming concept, and a
   list of some of the main SR functions.

5.4.  UPF Chaining with SRV6

   Service or function chaining is another intrinsic feature of SR and
   its SRV6 derivative.  Using this capability, operators can direct
   user traffic through a set of UPFs where each UPF performs a specific
   task or executes certain functions on the traffic.

   UPF chaining is achieved through the use of SIDs in SRV6 in the
   manner identical to what was described in the previous section
   regarding SRV6 support for traffic engineering.

Internet-Drafdraft-bogineni-dmm-optimized-mobile-user-plane    June 2018


   Generally speaking, the SRH is populated with a set of SIDs with each
   SID identifying a specific UPF in the network.  Starting from the
   ingress SRV6 node, packets are then forwarded through the network in
   either loose or explicit mode toward each UPF.

   Please refer to [I-D.xuclad-spring-sr-service-chaining] for further
   detail.

5.5.  SRV6 and Entropy

   Ability to provide a good level of entropy is an important aspect of
   data plane protocols.  The TEID field in GTP tunnels if included in
   network node's hashing algorithms can result in good load balancing.
   Therefore, any new data plane proposal should be able to deal with
   entropy in an efficient manner.

   SRV6 SIDs can easily accommodate entropy at either hop by hop or
   global level via reserving a set of bits in the SID construct itself;
   and hence, eliminate the need for a special entropy Segment ID in
   SRH.  Here, the hashing algorithm at different nodes distribute
   traffic flows based on the SID which has been copied to IPV6 DA
   field.

   Alternatively, entropy related information can be encoded as optional
   TLV field in SRV6's SRH.

6.  SRV6 and 5G Slicing

   Slicing is one of the main features in 5G [3GPP 23501].  Several
   Slices with different requirements can coexist on top of the common
   network infrastructure.  Diverse flows belonging to different 5G
   slices can be completely disjoint or can share different parts of the
   network infrastructure.  SRV6's native features such as TE, Chaining,
   one-plus-one protection, etc. either in stand-alone or in conjunction
   with other alternatives for mobility support such as ID-LOC model
   lend themselves well to 5G slicing paradigm.

   TBD

6.2.  SRV6 and Alternative Approaches to Advanced Mobility Support

   SRV6 flexibility enables it to support different methods of providing
   mobility in the network.  ID-LOC for mobility support is one such
   option.

6.2.1.  SRV6 and Locator/ID Separation Paradigm for N9 Interface

   The previous sections discussed how SRV6 could be employed as a
   replacement for GTP tunnels while leaving the existing control plane
   intact.  This section describes the use of SRV6 as a vehicle to
   implement Locator/ID Separation model for UPF data plane
   connectivity.

6.2.2.  Brief Overview of Locator-ID Separation

   Traditional routing architecture uses IP addresses as both device
   identity and its location in the network.  Locator-ID Separation
   model establishes a paradigm in which a device identity and its
   network location are split into two separate namespaces: End-point
   Identifiers (EID), and Route Locators (RLOC) that are correlated via



Bogigeni, et al.        Expires December 9, 2018               [Page 22]

Internet-Drafdraft-bogineni-dmm-optimized-mobile-user-plane    June 2018


   a control plane, or a dynamic (centralised or distributed) mapping
   system.

   RLOCs are tied to network topology.  They represent network devices
   that are reachable via traditional routing.  EIDs, on the other hand,
   represent mobile or stationary devices, functions, etc. that are
   reachable via different RLOCs based on the network location where
   they get instantiated, activated or moved.

   Using this model, as long as EID-RLOC relationship remains up to
   date, EIDs can easily move between the RLOCs.  That is the EID
   namespace can freely move without any impact to the routing paths and
   connectivity between the Route Locators.

   This type of multi encapsulation and routing has been employed in
   fixed networks (IP, VPN, MPLS, etc.).  The use of this paradigm in
   mobile data plane, therefore, offers an approach that takes advantage
   of a mature and proven technology to implement the N9 interface for
   UPF connectivity.

6.2.3.  Locator-ID Separation via SRV6 for UPF connectivity

   SRV6 can easily implement ID-LOC Separation model for UPF
   connectivity.  The SIDs are once again the main vehicle here.  In
   this model, UPFs are considered to be the IDs while the nodes where
   the UPFs attach to take on the role of the Locators.  Multiple UPFs
   are allowed to attach to the same Locator.  It is also possible for a
   UPF to connect to multiple Locators.  There are several
   implementation options.  The followings highlights a few
   possibilities.

6.2.3.1.  Overlay model with SRV6 Locators

   In this approach, UPFs connect to SRV6 capable Locators.  UPFs use
   IPV4/IPV6 transport either in conjunction with GTP or without any GTP
   tunnel and send the packets to their associated Locator at the near
   end (Ingress SRV6 Locator).

   In either case, the ingress SRV6 Locator uses the DA field in
   arriving packets to identify the far end Locator (Egress SRV6
   Locator) where the target UPF is attached and obtains its associated
   SID.

   For GTP encapsulated traffic from UPFs, the ingress SRV6 Locator must
   also deliver GTP information to the far end Locator.  Please see
   section 5.2. for more information on different methods of conveying
   GTP information in SRV6 domains.




Bogigeni, et al.        Expires December 9, 2018               [Page 23]

Internet-Drafdraft-bogineni-dmm-optimized-mobile-user-plane    June 2018


   The ingress SRV6 Locator then constructs the SRH and sends the
   traffic through the SRV6 network toward the egress RV6 Locator.
   Egress Locator marks the end of the segment and ships the traffic to
   the target UPF.

   It must be noted that use of GTP at UPFs allows us to leave the 3GPP
   control plane intact and hence provides a smooth migration path
   toward SRV6 with ID-Locator model.  For inter UPF traffic that
   doesn't use GTP, the control plane requires some modifications in
   order to be able to convey endpoint information to interested
   parties.

6.2.3.2.  SRV6 Capable UPFs and RLOCs

   In this model, the head end UPF (Ingress UPF) is the ingress node and
   the entity that constructs the SRH in the SRV6 domain.  Here, both
   UPFs (IDs) and Locators are represented by SIDs in the SRH.  The SID
   list establishes either a partial or the full path to a target or a
   set of UPFs that traffic is required to traverse.

   The 3GPP control plane is responsible for distributing UPF's endpoint
   information.  But it requires some modifications to be able to convey
   endpoint information to interested parties.

   In its simplest form, the SMF using policy information prepares a set
   of one or more UPFs along the traffic path and distributes this set
   in the form a SID list to the ingress UPF.  This SID list of UPFs is
   then gets augmented with a set of SIDs identifying the Locators
   representing the current point of attachment for each UPF along the
   data path.

Internet-Drafdraft-bogineni-dmm-optimized-mobile-user-plane    June 2018


   Alternatively, the SMF can provide a fully resolved SID list by
   communicating with a centralised or distributed ID-LOC mapping system
   containing all the relevant data regarding the UPF-Locator
   relationship.

   In yet another approach, the SMF can provide a partial SID list
   representing the segment between each pair of UPFs to individual UPFs
   along the path.

   Regardless of the approach, any changes to UPF's point of attachment
   must be reflected in the mapping system and communicated to the SMF
   for distribution to the appropriate set of UPFs.  Keeping the mapping
   system current is essential to proper operation.  As long as the
   mapping database is up-to-date, UPFs can be easily moved in the
   network.  Design of ID-Locator mapping system is beyond the scope of
   this document.  However, experiment with distributed mapping systems
   offered by today's public clouds has shown very promising results
   which can be further improved and tailored to mobile network
   requirements.

   The following figure shows the use of SRV6 UPFs and RLOCs in 5G.

6.3.  Areas of Concerns

   Support for IPV6 is a precondition for SRV6.  Although SRV6 can
   support hybrid IPV4/IPV6 mobile data plane through an interworking
   node, support of UPFs with IPV4 address is rather complex.

   Due to IPV6 128-bit address space, large SRH size can have a negative
   impact on MTU.  Large SRH size can also exert undesirable header tax
   especially in the case of small payload size.  Furthermore, compound
   SID processing at each node might affect line rate.

   ID-LOC architecture relies on high performance mapping systems.
   Distributed mapping systems using some form Distributed Hash
   Table(DHT) exhibit very promising results.  But further investigation
   is required to ensure mobility requirements in mobile data plane.

7.1.  Overview

   The Locator/Identifier Separation Protocol (LISP), which provides a
   set of functions for routers to exchange information used to map from
   Endpoint Identifiers (EIDs) that are not globally routable to
   routable Routing Locators (RLOCs).  It also defines a mechanism for
   these LISP routers to encapsulate IP packets addressed with EIDs for
   transmission across a network infrastructure that uses RLOCs for
   routing and forwarding.

   An introduction to LISP can be found in [I-D.ietf-lisp-introduction].

   A complete RFC-set of specifications can be found in [RFC6830],
   [RFC6831], [RFC6832], [RFC6833], [RFC6836], [RFC7215], [RFC8061],
   [RFC8111].  They describe support and mechanisms for all combinations
   of inner and outer IPv4 and IPv6 packet headers for unicast and
   multicast packet flows that also interwork with non-LISP sites as
   well as two designs to realize a scalable mapping system.

   A standards-track based set of drafts [I-D.ietf-lisp-rfc6830bis]
   [I-D.ietf-lisp-rfc6833bis] are products and work in progress of the
   LISP Working Group.

7.2.  LISP Data-Plane

   LISP uses dynamic tunnel encapsulation as its fundadmental mechanism
   for the data-plane.  Fixed headers are used between the outer and
   inner IP headers which are 16 bytes in length.  Details can be found
   in [RFC6830].

7.3.  LISP Control-Plane

   Many years of research dating back to 2007 have gone into LISP
   scalable mapping systems.  They can be found at [LISP-WG] and [IRTF-
   RRG].  The two that show promise and have deployment experience are
   LISP-DDT [RFC8111] and LISP-ALT [RFC6836].

   The control-plane API which LISP xTRs are the clients of is
   documented in [RFC6833].  Various mapping system and control-plane
   tools are available [RFC6835] [RFC8112] and are in operational use.

7.4.  LISP Mobility Features

   LISP supports multi-homed shortest-path session survivable mobility.
   An EID can remain fixed for a node that roams while its dynamic
   binding changes to the RLOCs it uses when it reconnect to the new
   network location.

   When the roaming node supports LISP, its EIDs and RLOCs are local to
   the node.  This form of mobility is call LISP Mobile-Node.  Details
   can be found in [I-D.ietf-lisp-mn].

   When the roaming node does not support LISP, but LISP runs in the
   network the node roams to, the EIDs and RLOCs are not co-located in
   the same device.  In this case, EIDs are assigned to the roaming node
   and RLOCs are assigned to LISP xTRs.  So when the roaming node
   attaches to the network, its EIDs are mapped to the RLOCs of the LISP

   xTRs in the network.  This form of mobility is called LISP EID-
   Mobility.  Details can be found in [I-D.ietf-lisp-eid-mobility].

   For a 3GGP mobile network, the LISP EID-Mobility form of mobility is
   recommended and is specified in the use-case document
   [I-D.farinacci-lisp-mobile-network].

7.5.  ILSR

   ILSR is a specific recommendation for using LISP in the 3GPP 5G
   mobile network architecture.  A detailed whitepaper can be found at
   [ILSR-WP].  The recommendation is to use the mechanisms in
   [I-D.farinacci-lisp-mobile-network].

7.6.  LISP Control-Plane with ILA Data-Plane

   The current LISP control-plane (LISP-CP) specification
   [I-D.ietf-lisp-rfc6833bis] is data-plane agnostic and can serve as
   control-plane for different data-plane protocols.  In this section we
   describe how LISP-CP can serve to enable the operation of an ILA
   data-plane.  A similar approach can be followed to use LISP-CP as
   control-plane for other data-plane protocols (e.g.  VXLAN, SRv6,
   etc).

   Below are summarized the major points to take into account when
   running LISP-CP as control-plane for ILA.

   o  Leveraging on the flexible LISP-CP address encoding defined in
      [RFC8060], different ILA address types are defined in
      [I-D.rodrigueznatal-ila-lisp] to carry ILA metadata over the LISP-
      CP.

   o  XTRs can serve as both ILA-Ns (when their map-cache is incomplete)
      or ILA-Rs (when their map-cache is complete).  XTRs serving as
      ILA-Rs subscribe to the Mapping System to populate their map-cache
      with all the mappings in the domain (or its shard) using
      [I-D.ietf-lisp-pubsub].

   o  LISP-CP can run over TCP or UDP.  The same signaling and logic
      applies independently of the transport.  Additionally, when
      running over TCP, the optimizations specified in
      [I-D.kouvelas-lisp-map-server-reliable-transport] can be applied.

   o  The ILA control-plane operations "request/response" and "push" are
      implemented via the LISP mechanisms defined in
      [I-D.ietf-lisp-rfc6833bis] and [I-D.ietf-lisp-pubsub]
      respectively.  When the Mapping System is co-located with the XTRs
      serving as ILA-Rs, the ILA "redirect" operation is implemented via
      the mapping notifications described in [I-D.ietf-lisp-pubsub].

   o  XTRs serving as ILA-Ns can use LISP-CP as described in
      [I-D.ietf-lisp-rfc6833bis] to register and keep updated in the
      Mapping System the information regarding their local mappings.

   o  When using ILA as data-plane, the mobility features and benefits
      discussed in Section 8 and in [I-D.ietf-lisp-eid-mobility] still
      apply.

   o  As discussed in [I-D.rodrigueznatal-ila-lisp], the LISP-CP can be
      used not only to resolve ID-Loc mappings but also to obtain the
      ILA Identifier when it is not possible to locally derivate it from
      the endpoint address.  These two mapping operations can be
      combined into one to obtain the ILA Identifier and associated
      locators in a single round of signaling.

8.  ILNP based Solution

   TBD

9.  ILA based Solution

   Identifier-Locator Addressing [I-D.herbert-intarea-ila] is a protocol
   to implement transparent network overlays without encapsulation.  It
   addresses the need for network overlays in virtualization and
   mobility that are efficient, lightweight, performant, scalable,
   secure, provide seamless mobility, leverage and encourage use of
   IPv6, provide strong privacy, are interoperable with existing
   infrastructure, applicable to a variety of use cases, and have
   simplified control and management.

10.  Overview of ILA

   ILA is a form of identifier/locator split where IPv6 addresses are
   transformed from application-visible, non-topological "identifier"
   addresses to topological "locator" addresses.  Locator addresses
   allow packets to be forwarded to the network location where a logical
   or mobile node currently resides or is attached.  Before delivery to
   the ultimate destination, locator addresses are reverse transformed
   back to the original application visible addresses.  ILA does address
   "transformation" as opposed to "translation" since address
   modifications are always undone.  ILA is conceptually similar to ILNP
   and 8+8, however ILA is contained in the network layer.  It is not

   limited to end node deployment, does not require any changes to
   transport layer protocols, and does not use extension headers.

   ILA includes both a data plane and control plane.  The data plane
   defines the address structure and mechanisms for transforming
   application visible identifier addresses to locator addresses.  The
   control plane's primary focus is a mapping system that includes a
   database of identifier to locator mappings.  This mapping database
   drives ILA transformations.  Control plane protocols disseminate
   identifier to locator mappings amongst ILA nodes.

   The use cases of ILA include mobile networks, datacenter
   virtualization, and network virtualization.  A recent trend in the
   industry is to build converged networks containing all three of these
   to provide low latency and high availability.  A single network
   overlay solution that works across multiple use cases is appealing.

   Benefits of ILA include:

   o  Facilitates node mobility and virtualization

   o  Multiple use cases (mobile, datacenter, cloud)

   o  Super efficient and performant data plane

   o  Allows strong privacy in addressing [ADDRPRIV]

   o  Promotes anchorless mobility

   o  No typical tunneling issues (e.g.  MTU) or management related to
      encapsulation

   o  Flexible control plane that splits data and control

   o  Modern "SDN" control protocols (e.g.  RPC/TCP)

   o  Scale number of nodes to billions for 5G, DC virtualization

   o  Upstream Linux kernel data path [ILAKERNEL] and open source ctrl
      plane [ILACONTROL].

   The ILA data plane protocol is described in
   [I-D.herbert-intarea-ila], motivation and problems areas are
   described in [ILAMOTIVE], ILA in the mobile user-plane is described
   in detail in [I-D.herbert-ila-mobile].

11.  ILA in the 5G Architecture

   ILA is a proposed alternative to GTP-U and encapsulation.  It does
   not require anchors and simplifies both the data plane and control
   plane.  ILA is a general network overlay protocol can be used to meet
   the requirements of use cases in a converged network.  User Plane
   Functions (UPF) with ILA are lightweight and stateless such that they
   can be brought up quickly as needed.

   Figure 15, Figure 16 depict two architectural options for the use of
   ILA in a 5G architecture.  ILA is logically a network function and
   ILA interfaces to the 5G control plane via service based interfaces.

   In this architecture, ILA replaces GTP use over the N9 interface.
   Identifier address to locator address transformations in the downlink
   from the data network are done by an ILA-R.  Transformations for
   intra domain traffic can be done by an ILA-N close to the gNB or by
   an ILA-R in the case of a cache miss.  Locator address to identifier
   address transformation happen at ILA-Ns.

   ILA could be supported on a gNB.  In this case, an ILA-N would be co-
   resident at a gNB and ILA is used over N3 interface in lieu GTP-U.

   Figure 16 and Figure 17 depict two options of how ILA can be used in
   the 5G architecture.  The control plane functions can be implemented
   as standalone network functions or can be implemented with other
   network functions.  The control plane protocol can be implemented as
   enhancement to N4, as APIs or as independent protocol.

   Use of ILA in roaming scenarios is still TBD.

11.2.  Control Plane

   ILA-M provides the interface between the 5G services architecture and
   the common ILA control plane.

11.2.1.  ILA-M services interface

   The control interface into ILA is via an ILA-M that interacts with 5G
   network services.  ILA-M uses RESTful APIs to make requests to
   network services.  An ILA-M receives notifications when devices enter
   the network, leave it, or move within the network.  The ILA-M writes
   the ILA mapping entries accordingly.

   ILA is a consumer of several 5G network services.  The service
   operations of interest to ILA are:

   o  Nudm (Unified Data Management): Provides subscriber information.

   o  Nsmf (Service Managment Function): Provides information about PDU
      sessions.

   o  Namf (Core Access and Mobility Function): Provides notifications
      of mobility events.

11.2.2.  ILA control plane

   The ILA control plane is composed of mapping protocols that manage
   and disseminate information about the mapping database.  There are
   two levels of mapping protocols: one used by ILA routers that require
   the full set of ILA mappings for a domain, and one used by ILA nodes
   that maintain a caches of mappings.

   The ILA mapping system is effectively a key/value datastore that maps
   identifiers to locators.  The protocol for sharing mapping
   information amongst ILA routers can thus be implemented by a
   distributed database [I-D.herbert-ila-ilamp].  ILA separates the
   control plane from the data plane, so alternative control plane
   protocols may be used with a common data plane
   [I-D.lapukhov-bgp-ila-afi], [I-D.rodrigueznatal-ila-lisp].

   The ILA Mapping Protocol [I-D.herbert-ila-ilamp] is used between ILA
   forwarding nodes and ILA mapping routers.  The purpose of the
   protocol is to populate and maintain the ILA mapping cache in
   forwarding nodes.  ILAMP defines redirects, a request/response
   protocol, and a push mechanism to populate the mapping table.  Unlike
   traditional routing protocols that run over UDP, this protocol is
   intended to be run over TCP and may be RPC oriented.  TCP provides
   reliability, statefulness implied by established connections,
   ordering, and security in the form of TLS.  Secure redirects are
   facilitated by the use of TCP.  RPC facilities such REST, Thrift, or
   GRPC leverage widely deployed models that are popular in SDN.

11.3.  IP addressing

   ILA supports single address assignments as well as prefix
   assignments.  ILA will also support strong privacy in addressing
   [ADDRPRIV].

11.3.1.  Singleton address assignment

   Singleton addresses can use a canonical 64/64 locator/identifier
   split.  Singleton addresses can be assigned by DHCPv6.

11.3.2.  Network prefix assignment

   Prefix assignment can be done via SLAAC or DHCPv6-PD.

   To support /64 prefix assignment with ILA, the ILA identifier can be
   encoded in the upper sixty-four bits of an address.  A level of
   indirection is used so that ILA transforms the upper sixty four bits
   to contain both a locator and an index into a locator (ILA-N)
   specific table.  The entry in the table provides the original sixty-
   four bit prefix so that locator to identifier address transformation
   can be done.

   As an example of this scheme, suppose network has a /24 prefix.  The
   identifier address format for /64 assignment might be:

   +-------------+---------------------|------------------------------+
   |  24 bits    |       40 bits       |          64 bits             |
   +-------------+---------------------|------------------------------+
   | Network     |      Identifier     |             IID              |
   +-------------+---------------------+------------------------------+

   The IID part is arbitrarily assigned by the device, so that is
   ignored by ILA.  All routing, lookups, and transformations (excepting
   checksum neutral mapping) are based on the upper sixty-four bits.

   For identifier to locator address transformation, a lookup is done on
   the upper sixty-four bits.  That returns a value that contains a
   locator and a locator table index.  The resulting packet format may
   be something like:

   +-------------+---------------------|------------------------------+
   |   24 bits   | 20 bits | 20 bits   |          64 bits             |
   +-------------+---------------------|------------------------------+
   |  Network    | Locator | Loc index |             IID              |
   +-------------+---------+-----------+------------------------------+

Internet-Drafdraft-bogineni-dmm-optimized-mobile-user-plane    June 2018


   The packet is forwarded and routed to the ILA-N addressed by locator
   (/44 route in this case).  At the ILA forwarding node, the locator
   index is used as a key to an ILA-N specific table that returns a 40
   bit Identifier.  This value is then written in the packet do ILA to
   identifier address transformation thereby restoring the original
   destination address.

   The locator index is not globally unique, it is specific to each ILA-
   N.  When a node attaches to an ILA-N, an index is chosen so that the
   table is populated at the ILA-N and the ILA mapping includes the
   locator and index.  When a node detaches from on ILA, it's entry in
   the table is removed and the index can be reused after a hold-down
   period to allow stale mappings to be purged.

11.3.3.  Strong privacy addresses

   Note that when a /64 is assigned to UEs, the assigned prefix may
   become a persistent identifier for a device.  This is a potential
   privacy issue.  [ADDPRIV] describes this problem and suggests some
   solutions that may be used with ILA.

11.4.  Traffic engineering

   ILA is primarily a mechanism for mobility and network virtualization.
   Transport mechanisms for traffic engineering such as MPLS, network
   slices, encapsulation, routing based on flow hash(flow label) can be
   applied independently of ILA.  This separation allows any discussion
   related to transport to be left to operator deployment.

11.5.  Locator Chaining with ILA

   ILA transformations can be performed on a hop-by-hop bases.  In this
   manner a packet can be source routed through a sequence of nodes.  At
   each hop a determination is made as to the next hop the packet should
   visit.  The locator for the target is then written into the
   destination.  Eventually, the packet will be forwarded to an ILA
   forwarding node that will restore the original address before
   delivery to the final destination.

11.6.  ILA and network slices

   Figure 19 illustrates the use of network slices with ILA.

                  Figure 19: ILA and network slices in 5G

   In this figure, slice #1 illustrates legacy use of UPFs without ILA
   in a slice.  ILA can be deployed incrementally or in parts of the
   network.  As demonstrated, the use of network slices can provide
   domain isolation for this.

   Slice #2 supports ILA.  Some number of ILA-Ns and ILA-Rs are
   deployed.  ILA transformations are performed over the N9 interface.
   ILA-Rs would be deployed at the N6 interface to perform
   transformations on packets received from a data network.  ILA-Ns will
   be deployed deeper in the network at one side of the N3 interface.
   ILA-Ns may be supplemented by ILA-Rs that are deployed in the
   network.  ILA-M manages the ILA nodes and mapping database within the
   slice.

   Slice #3 shows another slice that supports ILA.  In this scenario,
   the slice is for Mobile Edge Computing.  The slice contains ILA-Rs
   and ILA-Ns, and as illustrated, it may also contain ILA_Hs that run
   directly on edge computing servers.  Note in this example, one ILA-M,
   and hence one ILA domain, is shared between slice #2 and slice #3.
   Alternatively, the two slices could each have their own ILA-M and
   define separate ILA domains.

11.7.  Security considerations

   A mobile public infrastructure has many considerations in security as
   well as privacy.  Fundamentally, a system must protect against
   misdirection for the purposes of hijacking traffic, spoofing,
   revealing user identities, exposing accurate geo-location, and Denial
   of Service attacks on the infrastructure.

   The ILA mapping system contains personally identifiable information
   (PII) including user identities and geo-location.  The information
   must be safeguarded.  An ILA domain is confined to one administrative
   domain, only trusted parties entities in the domain participate in
   ILA.  There is no concept of a global, public mapping system and UEs
   in public networks generally do not participate in ILA protocols
   since they are untrusted.  ILA control protocols, include ILA
   redirects, use TCP.  TLS or other protocols can be applied for strong
   security.

   Privacy in addressing is a consideration.  ILA endeavors to provide a
   mechanism of address assignment that prevents inference of user
   identity or location.  This problem is described in [ADDRPRIV].

12.  Coexistence of 5GS and ID Locator Separation Architecture

12.1.  Overview of the Low Impact Approach

   ID-Locator separation architecture can be implemented by control
   plane of a dedicated protocol such as LISP, ILNP, ILA, etc., however,
   it may cause major impact to the specifications of 3GPP 5GS.  This
   approach, described in [I-D.homma-dmm-5gs-id-loc-coexistence],
   enables to introduce such ID-Locator separation protocols into 5GS
   with no or low impacts.  It would also support a migration path
   toward a network which an ID-Locator separation protocol is
   completely incorporated.

   This approach establishes an individual domain/slice in which an ID-
   Locator separation protocol works as packet forwarding mechanism, and
   divert appropriate packets to the domain by using Up-Link Classifier
   (ULCL) which is a fundamental function of UPF.  An overview of this
   architecture is shown in Figure 20.

   LOC-node is a node which has a locator and forwards packets to
   appropriate destination based on looking up of destination ID.  It is
   defined as xTR in LISP, and defined ILA-Node in ILA.  Mapping System
   manages IDs of end points (e.g., UE, NF in dDN) and their bineded
   Locators which each ID is connected.

12.2.  Data Plane

   GTP-U or any forwarding protocol described in this document can be
   used as data plane mechanism of this approach.  However, each LOC-
   Node must be connected to the all other LOC-Nodes and thus it may
   cause complexity of path management if you use a protocol which needs
   session establishment.

12.3.  Control Plane

   A control plane of every dedicated ID-Locator separation protocol
   described in this document can be used for this approach.  For
   management of mobility of UEs in ID-Locator separation domain, some
   cooperation between SMF and mapping system is needed.  In this
   approach, a UE is attached to a LOC-Node only when it communicates to
   another UE or an NF in a dDN.  In 5GS, SMF manages sessions, and thus
   SMF may be required to update mapping database when an UE moves to
   under another UPF or an NF is moved to another dDN.  The impact
   caused by such cooperation can be reduced by using Naf interface
   which is defined in 5GS specifications.

12.4.  Features

   This approach provides a mechanism for introducing ID-Locator
   separation architecture into 5GS with no or nominal impact, and
   achieves optimization of forwarding path and session continuity.
   Moreover, this can keep scalability on forwarding on down link from
   cDN/Internet because it can use the current GTP-based mechanism.

   On the other hand, this approach causes an extra hop when diverting
   packets to ID-Locator separation domain, and it may leads to increase
   of latency.

13.  hICN-based mobility architecture

13.1.  Overview

   *Locator-based architectures*

   IP communication relies solely on locators (host interfaces'
   addresses) that are also used as node/service identifiers at network
   layer.  Such semantic overloading of IP addresses as both identifiers
   and locators does not allow to disentangle locators from location-
   independent traffic identifiers, thus complexifying mobility
   management.






Bogigeni, et al.        Expires December 9, 2018               [Page 41]

Internet-Drafdraft-bogineni-dmm-optimized-mobile-user-plane    June 2018


   As a result, traffic anchors and tunnels have been introduced to
   handle mobility while preserving the identifier exposed to the
   transport layer.

   *Locator-ID separation architectures*

   To overcome the limitations of purely locator-based architectures,
   there have been proposed the so called "identifier/locator
   separation" (or Loc/ID split) schemes, using separate namespaces for
   identifiers and locators, and a mapping system allowing routers to
   bind them together.

   Loc/ID split has been originally proposed by LISP, and is central to
   ILSR and ILNP proposals.  The other approaches reviewed in this
   document, namely ILA, or the SRv6 proposal, also falls in the same
   category and share the requirements of a mapping system.  This
   service can be centralized/decentralized or distributed where a
   correspondence of ID and locators is stored and updated upon changes.

   *ID-based architectures*

   A third class of approaches exists that redefines IP communication
   principles (i.e. network and transport layers) around location-
   independent identifiers [I-D.vonhugo-5gangip-ip-issues].

   The work done around Information-Centric Networking (ICN) falls into
   such class of approaches that we refer to as purely ID-based, also
   known as name-based [I-D.irtf-icnrg-terminology], and whose
   properties especially for mobility management we focus on in the rest
   of the section.

13.2.  Benefits

   The appeal of purely ID-based architectures is that they move Loc/ID
   split one step further by embedding ID-awareness in the network and
   transport layer by default and as such completely decoupling data
   delivery from underlying network connectivity.  Forwarding is
   performed directly based on identifiers stored in routers' FIBs and
   no mapping of ID into locators is required.  In this way, purely ID-
   based architectures remove the need to maintain a global mapping
   system at scale, and its intrinsic management complexity.

   Additional benefits brought specifically by ICN principles motivate
   the consideration of ICN solutions for next generation mobility
   architectures, e.g.

   o  the flexibility of multi-source/multi-path connectionless pull-
      based transport.  An example is the native support for consumer

      mobility, i.e. the transparent emission of data requests over
      multiple and varying available network interfaces during node
      mobility;

   o  the opportunity to define fine-grained per-application forwarding
      and security policies.

   An overview of ICN principles and advantages for a simplified
   mobility management resulting from name-based forwarding can be found
   in [RFC7476].

13.3.  Hybrid Information-Centric Networking (hICN)

   Hybrid ICN (hICN) is an ICN architecture that defines integration of
   ICN semantics within IPv6, instead of over/under/aside.  The only
   difference w.r.t.  ICN as defined in [I-D.irtf-icnrg-ccnxsemantics]
   is that it encodes names inside IP addresses, and thus can use RFC-
   compliant TCP/IP packets to transport ICN semantics.

   The goal of hICN is to ease ICN insertion in existing IP
   infrastructure by:

   1.  selective insertion of hICN capabilities in a few network nodes
       at the edge (no need for pervasive fully hICN network
       enablement);

   2.  guaranteed transparent interconnection with hICN-unaware IP
       nodes, without using overlays;

   3.  minor modification to existing IP routers/endpoints (e.g. reuse
       of IP FIBs and of existing buffers, no modifications to L7
       applications and user space hICN transport layer introduction in
       endpoints);

   4.  re-use of existing IP control plane (e.g. for routing of IP
       prefixes carrying ID-semantics) along with performing mobility
       management and caching operations in forwarding plane;

   5.  fallback capability to traditional IP network/transport layer.

   hICN architecture is described in detail in
   [I-D.muscariello-intarea-hicn].  Hereafter we focus on mobility
   management in hICN and on the possible deployment options for
   insertion in 5G SBA.

13.4.  hICN-based mobility

   In ICN and hICN endpoints can act as consumers and/or producers.
   Consumers when they emit requests for named data packets (so called
   Interests), producers when they send data packets in response to
   consumers request (pull-based transport model).

   Clearly a node can be a consumer and a producer at the same time
   (e.g. in a voice conversation).

   Consumer and producer mobility are handled in a different way due to
   the pull-based request model.  More specifically, consumer mobility
   is natively supported: consumers pull traffic by sending Interest
   packets towards named content (wherever produced/stored, the source
   is a priori unknown by the consumer).  Interests are named-based
   forwarded using the information found in traversed routers' FIBs.

   In case of consumer mobility, i.e. mobility of the endpoint issuing
   the requests, selection of a new available output interface and
   retransmission of not-yet-satisfied Interests is sufficient for data
   delivery to continue, independently from the underlying change of
   locators.  Consumer mobility is fully anchorless with hICN, and does
   not incur any signalization nor tunneling overhead.

   Producer mobility is not natively supported by ICN architecture,
   rather handled in different ways according to the selected producer
   mobility management scheme.

   In [I-D.irtf-icnrg-mapme] and [MAPME] producer mobility schemes are
   classified into four classes:

   o  _Resolution based_ solutions rely on dedicated rendez-vous nodes
      (similar to DNS) which map content names into routable location
      identifiers.  To maintain this mapping updated, the producer
      signals every movement to the mapping system.  Once the resolution
      is performed, packets can be correctly routed directly to the
      producer.

   o  _Anchor-based_ proposals are inspired by Mobile IP, and maintain a
      mapping at network-layer by using a stable home address advertised
      by a rendez-vous node, or anchor.  This acts as a relay,
      forwarding through tunneling both interests to the producer, and
      data packets coming back.

   o  _Tracing-based_ solutions allow the mobile node to create a hop-
      by-hop forwarding reverse path from its RV back to itself by
      propagating and keeping alive traces stored by all involved

      routers.  Forwarding to the new location is enabled without
      tunneling.

   o  _Anchorless_ approaches allow the mobile nodes to advertise their
      mobility to the network without requiring any specific node to act
      as a rendez-vous point.

   The selected mobility management scheme for hICN is MAP-Me, an
   anchorless producer mobility management solution originally proposed
   for ICN [I-D.irtf-icnrg-mapme] [MAPME] and further extended to hICN
   in [I-D.auge-hicn-mobility].

   MAP-Me belongs to the class of anchorless approaches that relies on
   scope-limited forwarding updates triggered by producer mobility
   events to keep locally up-to-date FIB information for a low-latency
   guaranteed reroute of consumer Interests towards changing location of
   the producer.

   The difference w.r.t. to other classes of approaches is that it does
   not require an anchor neither in forwarding plane (traffic does not
   need to pass through a specific network node), nor in the control
   plane (no rendez-vous point, no mapping system).

   As detailed in [I-D.auge-hicn-mobility] using MAP-Me, hICN provides
   anchorless consumer and producer mobility removing the need for
   tunnels and for ID mapping.

   Signaling of mobility is only required upon producer movements and
   limited in scope to current-to-previous network hops.  Unlike routing
   updates, it is not necessary to update all routers' FIBs after a node
   has moved, but only those located on the path between the new and a
   former position of the producer.  MAP-Me realizes this process in a
   distributed fashion through in-band signaling packets, hence its
   anchorless property with respect to the control plane too.
   Scalability of producer mobility is guaranteed by an efficient and
   secure FIB update process with minimal and bounded path stretch.

   Forwarding and mobility management operations in hICN are based only
   location-independent identifiers, preserving coexistence with IP
   locators whose existence may be required by non-hICN services and by
   control/management plane operations specific to the considered
   network architecture.  As an example, in the case of 3GPP
   architectures, MAP-Me mobility management does not require an
   additional control plane anchor.

13.5.  hICN insertion in the 3GPP 5G architecture

   [I-D.auge-hicn-mobility-deployment-options] reviews various insertion
   strategies for hICN, including overlay deployments using local
   breakout to hICN instances situated in MEC, or hICN forwarders
   deployed within an UPF.  While those approaches have the merit of
   allowing an easy or early integration of hICN and exploiting some of
   its benefits, they do not fully exploit purely ID-based capabilities
   nor the dynamic hICN forwarding.

   Thus, in this section, we focus our attention on more integrated
   approaches leveraging hICN-enriched mobile backhaul network to offer
   an alternative to GTP-U tunnels over the N9 (and possibly N3)
   Interfaces, as shown in Figure 2 and Figure 7.

13.5.1.  Control plane considerations

   By operating directly on routers' FIBs for mobility updates, dynamic
   hop-by-hop forwarding strategies etc., hICN inherits the simplicity
   of IP forwarding and reuses IP routing protocols for ID prefixes
   advertisement and routing.  In this way it removes the challenges of
   managing a distributed mapping service at scale (cache update/
   refresh, etc.).  In addition it remains compatible with the exiting
   control plane architecture as proposed in the 3GPP standard, with no
   change required to N1, N2 or N4.

   MAP-Me anchorless producer mobility management does not imply SMF
   interaction, but does not exclude neither to use SMF signaling to
   trigger MAP-Me updates or to handle FIB updates, at the condition to
   follow the same procedure described for MAP-Me.  However, the absence
   of SMF interaction might be beneficial in case of dense deployments
   or failure of the central control entities (infrastructure-less
   communication scenarios) to empower distributed control of local
   mobility within an area.

13.5.2.  Replacement of N9 interface only

   Replacing only the N9 interface (which represents the interface
   between UPFs, and as such most of the backhaul network) is the
   initial target of our study.  This has the advantage of not touching
   the gNB as illustrated in Figure 21.  The corresponding protocol
   layering is shown in Figure 22 where we assume hICN-enablement of the
   end-points (the suboptimal case of hICN enablement via proxies is not
   considered in this document).  We remark that in the protocol layer,
   hICN is associated to IPv6 PDU layer, transported over N9 directly
   over L2.

13.5.4.  Enhanced data plane: hICN/SRv6 combination

   hICN is designed to operate inside an IPv6 network by means of an
   enriched communication layer supporting ICN primitives.  The targeted
   deployment of a few hICN-empowered nodes leads to the tradeoff
   between incremental deployment and benefits which are proportionally
   related to the degree of hICN penetration.  The association of hICN
   with other data planes technologies is investigated as a possibility




Bogigeni, et al.        Expires December 9, 2018               [Page 48]

Internet-Drafdraft-bogineni-dmm-optimized-mobile-user-plane    June 2018


   to overcome the above-mentioned tradeoff yielding to a selective, yet
   fully beneficial insertion of hICN in IP networks.

   To this aim, we focus on hICN insertion in a Segment Routing (SR)
   enhanced data plane, specifically considering SRv6 instantiation of
   SR.  More details are provided in
   [I-D.auge-hicn-mobility-deployment-options].

   hICN/SRv6 combination inherits all SRv6 advantages presented in SR-
   dedicated section of this document, namely "underlay" management
   (fast reroute, etc.), service chaining or fine-grained TE for
   instance.

   In addition, it allows extending the reach of hICN on regular IP
   routers with SRv6 functionality.  One realization being to create
   SRv6 domains in between hICN nodes.  The hICN router (through
   forwarding strategies) would then act as a control plane for SRv6 by
   specifying the list of SIDs to insert in the packet.

   SRv6 forwarding of packets between hICN hops would allow to enforce
   dynamic per-application hICN forwarding strategies and their
   objectives (path steering, QoS, etc.), which would be otherwise not
   possible over not hICN-enabled IP network segments.  It would also
   allow dynamic multi-path and load balancing in hICN-unaware IP
   network segments and it could guarantee request/reply IP path
   symmetry (instrumental for efficient round trip delay measurements
   and rate/congestion control).

13.6.  Benefits

   Benefits of the deployed solution result both from the purely
   identifier-based approach, as well as from specific hICN properties.
   We provide an overview of expected benefits, described in more detail
   with examples in [I-D.auge-hicn-mobility-deployment-options].

13.6.1.  hICN benefits

   We review benefits resulting from the deployment of hICN nodes, not
   specific to the replacement of N9.

   o  Low-latency and multicast capabilities by means of in-path edge
      caching

   The ability to satisfy UE requests close to the access is important
   for latency-sensitive applications such as AR/VR and for cost-
   efficient transport (that minimizes high-throughput traffic carrying
   to the core when it can be satisfied locally).




Bogigeni, et al.        Expires December 9, 2018               [Page 49]

Internet-Drafdraft-bogineni-dmm-optimized-mobile-user-plane    June 2018


   In addition, hICN ability to serve requests from cache or to
   aggregate them implicitly realizes opportunistic multicast
   distribution of popular content improving users' QoE for service such
   as VoD or live streaming, while greatly offloading the mobile core.

   o  Consumer mobility improvements

   The combined use of identifiers and a pull-model allows for seamless
   mobility across heterogeneous wired and wireless networks, as well as
   their simultaneous use for multi-homing and bandwidth aggregation.  A
   specific feature of hICN is to allow the use of multiple path/sources
   of content at the same time, for instance edge caches located at the
   edge of different fixed/mobile network accesses.

   o  Network-assisted transport

   On-path insertion of hICN enables the use of network buffers to
   optimize traffic engineering including multipath and load balancing
   support.  One interesting deployment consists in enabling hICN in the
   PDU Session Anchor, so as to allow two downstream paths back to the
   mobile edge (due to hICN replacing the datagram source address by the
   locator of the output UPF), thereby exploiting additional upstream
   path diversity / resiliency.  The ability to perform in-network
   assistance (for rate/loss/congestion control) is an additional
   advantage, e.g.  to support rate adaptation in the case of dynamic
   adaptive streaming, or to improve reliability of WiFi connection
   through transparent wireless detection and recovery [WLDR].

13.6.2.  Additional benefits resulting from N9 replacement

   o  Anchorless consumer and producer mobility

   Removing N9 tunnels is key to allow a fully anchorless solution, by
   not forcing all traffic to transit through the anchoring point in the
   core.  Local forwarding decisions will allow the offloading of
   device-to-device communications when the different UEs are
   topologically close, as well as network operations when some areas
   are disconnected from the core (disaster recovery for instance).

   o  Dynamic forwarding strategies / UPF selection

   Dynamic selection of next hop or exit point is simplified as it can
   be performed locally based on identifiers and/or locally available
   information (e.g.  interface measurements) in virtue of service-
   specific forwarding strategies.

Internet-Drafdraft-bogineni-dmm-optimized-mobile-user-plane    June 2018


13.6.3.  Additional benefits resulting from N3 replacement

   o  Removal of tunnel management state and signaling

   The clear advantage is the complete removal of tunnels.  Forwarding
   beyond the radio access is directly managed through hICN.  As a
   consequence, no additional state nor signaling is required for static
   and mobile consumers, nor for static producers.  The impact of
   producer mobility is low because of the small number of impacted
   routers.

   Deploying hICN on both N3 and N9 further presents the advantage of
   removing the need for inter-networking with remaining GTP tunnels
   between those two interfaces.  The result is a simpler and lighter
   architecture, allowing convergence with other non-3GPP accesses.

   o  Dynamic first UPF selection

   Dynamic forwarding capabilities are extended in this configuration to
   the selection of the first UPF, with the potential of additional
   performance improvement and higher traffic offload because of the
   deployment of hICN functionalities closer to the UE.  A significant
   advantage arises in dense deployments scenarios where it becomes
   possible to isolate the core network from the locally-management
   mobility (a design objective of the mobile architecture), while
   allowing distributed selection of ingress UPFs, and dynamic per-
   packet load balancing of traffic across them.

13.6.4.  Deployment considerations

   The benefits previously described can be obtained by an upgrade of
   only a few selected routers at the network edge.  The design of hICN
   allows the rest of the infrastructure to remain unmodified, and to
   leverage existing management and monitoring tools.

13.6.4.1.  hICN in a slice

   The use of hICN does not impose any specific slicing of the network.
   Rather, it can assist a transition of services towards hICN, and/or
   the coexistence of different hICN deployment options.

   As an example of use of hICN in a slice, a service provider might for
   instance decide to use an hICN-enabled slice dedicated to video
   delivery, with appropriate mobility management, and dedicated hICN
   nodes with appropriate caching/forwarding strategies at places
   aggregating considerable number of user requests.

Internet-Drafdraft-bogineni-dmm-optimized-mobile-user-plane    June 2018


13.6.4.2.  End-to-end deployment

   The deployment of an hICN stack in endpoints is the preferred option
   and offers the full range of benefits.  The hICN network stack and
   forwarder are available through two reference implementations based
   on the CICN project [CICN].  They share an objective of smooth
   deployment in existing devices, and are fully userland based.  The
   first is built on top of existing IP primitives and proposed as an
   application/library for all major OS vendors including iOS, Android,
   Linux and Windows.  The second targets high-performance routers and
   servers, and leverages the VPP kernel-bypass technology.

13.6.4.3.  Network-contained deployment

   It is not always possible nor desirable to affect endpoints, and a
   deployment fully contained in the network, or within the N9 interface
   is possible through the deployment of proxies.  An overview of
   different options implemented at the network, transport or
   application level are considered.  An example would be the deployment
   of HTTP proxies at the ingress and egress (resp.  first and last
   UPFs), in order to benefit from content awareness in the network.
   Such configuration however reduces the flexibility and dynamic
   forwarding capabilities in endpoints.  In particular, existing
   transport protocols have limited support for dynamically changing
   paths or network conditions.

   Traffic that is not handled though hICN mechanisms can still benefit
   from the lower overhead and anchorless mobility capabilities coming
   from the removal of GTP tunnels, as well as dynamic forwarding
   capabilities that are inherent to the forwarding pipeline.  This
   results from the ability to assign location-independent identifiers
   to endpoints.  It preserves the advantage of removing the mapping
   system, and of a lightweight FIB update process.  No encapsulation is
   required and packet headers are not modified, which allows the
   network to have visibility in the source and/or destination
   identifiers.

13.7.  Summary

   hICN proposes a general purpose architecture that combines the
   benefits of a pure-ID architecture with those of ICN.  While a full
   deployment is recommended to make efficient use of available network
   resources, it is still possible to opt for a partial or phased
   deployment, with the associated tradeoffs that we have reviewed here.

   An hICN enabled network offers native offloading capabilities thanks
   to the anchorless properties resulting from the pure-ID communication
   scheme.  It does so without the need for a third party mapping

   system, and further requires no change in the 5G architecture nor in
   its control plane.  The architecture will further leverage the
   incremental insertion of information centric functionalities through
   proxies or direct insertion in user devices as the technology gets
   adopted and deployed.

14.  No Protocol Option

   In this option, mobility is handled nomadically by the app.

15.  Comparison of Protocols

   This section will compare the different protocols with reference to
   how they will support the requirements for UPF and N9 interface; how
   the various scenarios identified in Sections 3 and 4 will be
   supported and impacts to other interfaces and functions of the
   architecture (e.g.  N3, N4, SMF, AMF, etc).

   # What is the criteria for comparison?

16.  Summary

   This document summarized the various IETF protocol options for GTP
   replacement on N9 interface of 3GPP 5G architecture.

17.  Formal Syntax

   The following syntax specification uses the augmented Backus-Naur
   Form (BNF) as described in [RFC2234].

18.  Security Consideration

   TBD

19.  IANA Considerations

   TBD
